Nos. 3,326,924, 3,717,647 and 4,282,233 describe certain 11-(4-piperidylidene)-5H-benzo[5,6]cyclohepta[1,2-b]pyridines.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	The present invention is directed to compounds having structural formula I: ##STR1## or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein X and Y independently represent H, halo (i.e., fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo), or trifluoromethyl with the proviso that at least one of X and Y is halo or trifluoromethyl. Particularly, preferred compounds are those wherein X is F and Y is H and wherein X is Cl and Y is H.	The compounds of the invention have unexpectedly been found to possess advantageous antihistaminic activity and low central nervous system (CNS) activity indicative of non-sedation. The compounds can thus be employed in pharmaceutical compositions in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and in methods of treating allergic reactions in a mammal.	DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION	
US4659716_0002	The compounds of the invention can form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids such as hydrochloric, methanesulfonic, sulfuric, acetic, maleic, fumaric, phosphoric and the like. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base form may be regenerated by treating the salt forms with a base. For example, dilute aqueous base solutions may be utilized. Dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia, and sodium bicarbonate solutions are suitable for this purpose. The free base form differs from the respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salts are otherwise equivalent to the respective free base form for purposes of the invention.	The compounds of the invention and their corresponding salts can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms, with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for purposes of the invention.	The compounds of the invention can be prepared by decarbalkoxylation of a compound of the formula II: ##STR2## wherein R is an alkyl group (preferably ethyl) and X and Y are as defined above. The compounds of formula II can be prepared by procedures described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,282,233 from the corresponding N-alkyl (preferably N-methyl) compounds of formula III ##STR3## by employing appropriate starting materials having the desired X and Y substituents.	Alternatively, the compounds of the invention can be prepared by dealkylation of compounds of formula III, e.g., by reaction with cyanogen bromide and subsequent hydrolysis of the N-cyano product with, for example, aqueous acid solution to provide the compounds of formula I.	The compounds of formula III can be produced by the procedures described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,326,924 by employing the appropriately X and Y substituted starting materials. For example, 2-cyano-3-picoline of formula IV can be reacted with an appropriate benzaldehyde of formula V in the presence of a strong base such as potassium butoxide to give an ortho-phenethenyl pyridine carboxamide of formula VI ##STR4## which is then hydrogenated, e.g., by employing a noble metal on carbon catalyst such as palladium or platinum on carbon, to the corresponding ortho-phenethyl pyridine carboxamide of formula VII ##STR5## which in turn is hydrolyzed, e.g, with base such KOH, to the otho-phenethyl pyridine carboxylic acid of formula VIII ##STR6## The compound of formula VIII can be cyclized, e.g., with oxalyl chloride and aluminum trichloride, to a compound of formula IX ##STR7## which is reacted with, for example, a Grignard reagent prepared from a 4-halo-N-alkyl-piperidine to produce the compound of formula X ##STR8## which in turn is dehydrated, e.g., by acid such as polyphosphoric acid or sulfuric acid, to the compound of formula III: ##STR9## The compound of formula IX may also be reacted with Na in liquid NH3 and a 4-halo-N-alkyl-piperidine to produce the compound of formula X.	In an alternative method 2-cyano-3-methylpyridine can be reacted in a Ritter reaction with a tertiary butyl compound in an acid such as concentrated sulfuric acid or concentrated sulfuric acid in glacial acetic acid to form a compound of formula XI ##STR10## Suitable tertiary butyl compounds include, but are not limited to, t-butyl alcohol, t-butyl chloride, t-butyl bromide, t-butyl iodide, isobutylene or any other compound which under hydrolytic conditions forms t-butyl carboxamides with cyano compounds. The temperature of the reaction will vary depending on the reactants, but generally the reaction is conducted in the range of from about 50° C. to about 100° C. with t-butyl alcohol. The reaction may be performed with inert solvents but is usually run neat.	The product of the Ritter reaction (formula XI) can be reacted with an appropriate 3 and/or 4-halo or trifluoromethyl-substituted benzyl halide, in the presence of a base to form the compound of formula XII ##STR11## wherein Z is chloro, bromo or iodo. Examples of appropriate benzyl halides include, but are not limited to, 3-chloro-benzyl chloride, 3-fluoro-benzyl bromide, 3,4-dichloro-benzyl chloride, 4-fluoro-benzyl chloride, 3-trifluoromethyl-benzyl chloride, 3-bromobenzyl chloride, etc. Any suitable base can be employed e.g., an alkyl lithium compound such as n-butyl lithium in tetrahyrofuran (THF). Preferably the base has a pKa of greater than 20 and more preferably greater than 30. This reaction can be conducted at any suitable temperature, e.g., temperatures of from about -78° C. to about 30° C., preferably from about -40° C. to about -30° C. The reaction can be performed in any suitable inert solvent such as THF, diethyl ether, etc.	The tertiary-butyl amide of formula XII can be converted to the cyano compound of formula XIII ##STR12## by the use of a suitable dehydrating agent such as POCl3, SOCl2, P2 O5, toluene sulfonyl chloride in pyridine, oxalyl chloride in pyridine, etc. This reaction can be performed in the absence of or with a co-solvent such as xylene. The dehydrating agent such as POCl3 is employed in equivalent amounts or greater and preferably in amounts of from about 2 to about 15 equivalents. Any suitable temperature and time can be employed for performing the reaction, but generally heat is added to speed up the reaction. Preferably, the reaction is performed at or near reflux.	The cyano compound of formula XIII can then be reacted with a Grignard reagent prepared from the appropriate 1-alkyl-4-halopiperidine. This reaction is generally performed in an inert solvent such as an ether, toluene or tetrahydrofuran. This reaction is performed under the general conditions for a Grignard reaction, e.g., at temperatures of from about 0° C. to about 75° C. The resulting compound of formula XIV ##STR13## (wherein Z is again chloro, bromo or iodo) is hydrolyzed, e.g., by reaction with aqueous acid such as aqueous HCl to prepare the corresponding ketone of formula XV ##STR14##	The compound of formula XV can be ring-closed to form the desired cycloheptene ring system by treating the compound XV with a super acid having a Hammett acidity function of less than about minus 12, e.g., minus 13, minus 14, etc., to produce a compound of formula III. This measure of acidity is defined in Hammett, Louis P., and Deyup, Alden J., Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 54, 1932, p. 2721. Suitable super acids for this purpose include, for example, HF/BF3, CF3 SO3 H, CH3 SO3 H/BF3, etc. The reaction can be performed in the absence of or with an inert co-solvent such as CH2 Cl2. The temperature and time of the reaction vary with the acid employed. For example, with HF/BF3 as the super acid system the temperature may be controlled so as to minimize side reactions, such as HF addition to the double bond of the rings. For this purpose, the temperature is generally in the range of from about +5° C. to -50° C., preferably from about -30° C. to -35° C. With CF3 SO3 H as the super acid system, the reaction may be run at elevated temperatures, e.g., from about 25° C. to about 150° C. and at lower temperatures but the reaction then takes longer to complete.	Generally the super acid is employed in excess, preferably in amounts of from about 1.5 to about 30 equivalents. For example, with HF/BF3 as the super acid system the molar ratio of HF to the compound of formula XV in the reaction mixture is preferably from about 30 to about 1.5, more preferably 2.5 to 1.5. In such system, the molar ratio of BF3 to the compound of formula XV in the reaction mixture is preferably from about 15 to about 0.75, more preferably from about 1 to about 0.75.	As another alternative, a compound of formula XII above can be cyclized by use of super acid such as CF3 SO3 H or HF/BF3 to produce a compound of formula IX. ##STR15## The compounds of formula IX may then be converted to the desired compounds of the invention as described above.	For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders or tablet disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active compound. In the tablet the active compound is mixed with carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from about 5 to about 20 percent of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component (with or without other carriers) is surrounded by carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.	For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and therey solidify.	Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection. Liquid preparations can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by adding the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing, sweetening, solubilizing and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, i.e., natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and other well-known suspending agents.	Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. These particular solid form preparations are most conveniently provided in unit dose form and as such are used to provide a single liquid dosage unit. Alternately, sufficient solid may be provided so that after conversion to liquid form, multiple individual liquid doses may be obtained by measuring predetermined volumes of the liquid form preparation as with a syringe, teaspoon or other volumetric container. When multiple liquid doses are so prepared, it is preferred to maintain the unused portion of said liquid doses at low temperature (i.e., under refrigeration) in order to retard possible decomposition. The solid form preparations intended to be converted to liquid form may contain, in addition to the active material, flavorants, colorants, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents and the like. The solvent utilized for preparing the liquid form preparation may be water, isotonic water, ethanol, glycerine, propylene glycol and the like as well as mixtures thereof. Naturally, the solvent utilized will be chosen with regard to the route of administration, for example, liquid preparations containing large amounts of ethanol are not suitable for parenteral use.	The composition of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally, e.g., with a transdermally acceptable carrier. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions and/or emulsions, can be included in an appropriate adhesive for application to the skin or can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.	Preferably, the transdermally acceptable composition is utilized to prepare a "reservoir type" or "matrix type" patch which is applied to the skin and worn for a specific period of time to permit the penetration of a desired amount of a compound of formula I through the skin. Most preferably, the patch of the invention will be worn for a period of about 24 hours and provide a total daily dosage of about 1 mg to about 40 l mg, preferably from about 5 mg to about 10 mg, of a compound of the invention. The patch may then be replaced if necessary with a fresh patch, thereby providing a constant blood level of a compound of formula I to the patient in need thereof.	The utilization of this new transdermal dosage form and its prescribed regimen will provide the advantages described above. Other frequencies of dosage application are anticipated, for example, a once every 3 day frequency or a once every 7 day frequency. Although a once a day dosage regimen may be preferred, it is not intended that the invention be limited to any particular regimen.	Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, for example, packeted tablets, capsules and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet or tablet itself or it can be the appropriate number of any of these packaged form.	The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from 1 mg to 1000 mg according to the particular application. The compositions can, if desired, also contain other therapeutic agents, such as decongestants.	The dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.	The compounds of the invention possess antihistaminic properties. The antihistaminic properties of these compounds may be demonstrated by use of standard pharmacological testing procedures. For example, the ability of the compounds to reduce histamine-induced paw edema in mice may be measured by use of the following method.	Male CF1 mice, 25-30 g, are housed under conditions of controlled temperature and humidity with a 12 hour dark/light cycle. Food and water are allowed ad libitum. The mice are randomly assigned to the treatment groups. One hour after treatment with a compound of the invention or vehicle, the mice are lightly anesthetized with ether. The left hind paw of each mouse serves as a control and is injected with 25 μl of isotonic saline. The right hind paw serves as the experimental paw and is injected with 25 μl of isotonic saline containing 13 μg histamine dihydrochloride. Thirty minutes later the mice are killed by cervical dislocation and both hind paws of each mouse are removed by cutting at the tarsal joint. The weight of each paw is recorded and the difference in weight between the compound-treated and the placebo-treated groups is evaluated using Student's "t" test. The ED50 values (the dose causing 50% inhibition of histamine-induced edema) and 95% confidence limits are determind by the Linear Least Square Dose-Response method [Brownlee, K. A., "Statistical Theory And Methodology In Science and Engineering", 2nd Ed., J. Wiley and Sons, New York, 1965, pp. 346-349]. The compounds of 8-chloro-6,11-dihydro-11-(4-piperidylidene)-5H-benzo[5,6]cyclohepta[1,2-b] pyridine (Compound A) and 8-fluoro-6,11 -dihydro-11-(4-piperidylidene)-5H-benzo[5,6]cyclohepta[1,2-b]pyridine (Compound B) were tested by this procedure with the results shown in Table 1 below:	TABLE 1	__________________________________________________________________________	Increased Paw Oral Dose No. of Weight (mg) Oral ED50 Treatment mg/kg Animals Mean % Inhibition (mg/kg)	__________________________________________________________________________	Placebo	-- 7 22.3 -- --	Compound A	0.03 8 19.9 11	0.1 7 13.0 42	0.3 8 6.1 73 0.15	1.0 8 2.5 89	Compound B <3	__________________________________________________________________________	Compounds A and B were also tested for antihistaminic activity by the procedures set forth in paragraph A below and for CNS activity by the procedures set forth in paragraphs B, C, and D below.	A. Prevention of histamine-induced lethality in guinea pigs. Compounds A and B were evaluated for their ability to protect female albino guinea pigs (250-350 g) against death induced by the intravenous injection of histamine dihydrochloride at 1.1 mg/kg, which is approximately twice the LD99. Doses of the antagonists were administered orally to separate groups of fasted animals 1 hour prior to the challenge with histamine and protection from death recorded for 30 minutes after histamine. ED50 values were determined for each drug by prohibit analysis.	B. Antagonism of Physostigmine Lethality. The physostigmine-induced lethality test used was a modification of the technique reported by COLLIER et al., Br. J. Pharmac., 32, 295-310 (1968). Physostigmine salicylate (b 1.0 mg/kg s.c.) produces 100% lethality when administered to mice grouped 10 per plastic cage (11×26×13 cm). Test agents were administered orally 30 minutes prior to physostigmine. The number of survivors were counted 20 minutes after physostigmine administration.	C. Antagonism of Acetic Acid Writhing. The acetic acid writhing test used was essentially that described by HENDERSHOT and FORSAITH, J. Pharmac. Exp. Ther., 125, 237-240 (1959), except that acetic acid rather than phenylquinone was used to elicit writhing. Mice were injected with 0.6% aqueous acetic acid at 10 mg/kg i.p. 15 minutes after oral administration of the test drug. The number of writhes for each animal was counted during a 10 minute period starting 3 minutes after acetic acid treatment. A writhe was defined as a sequence of arching of the back, pelvic rotation and hind limb extension.	D. Antagonism of Electro-Convulsive Shock (ECS). For the ECS test, a modification of the method of TOMAN et al., J. Neurophysiol., 9, 231-239 (1946), was used. One hour after oral administration of the test drug or vehicle, mice were administered a 13 mA, 60 cycle a.c. electroconvulsant shock (ECS) for 0.2 seconds via corneal electrodes. This shock intensity produces tonic convulsions, defined as extension of the hind limbs, in at least 95% of vehicle-treated mice.	Of the above test procedures for measuring CNS activity of antihistamines, the physostigmine-induced lethality test is believed to be a major index of non-sedating characteristics, since it reflects mainly central anticholinergic potency which is believed to contribute to sedative activity.	The results from the above test procedures are set forth in Table 2 below: PG,18	TABLE 2	______________________________________	Antihistaminic Activity CNS Activity A. G. pig. B. Physostigmine C.

US4659716_0003	______________________________________	The above results demonstrate that the compounds of the invention are a potent antihistamines having low CNS activity indicative of non-sedation. Specifically, Compounds A and B are relatively inactive in all of the CNS test procedures, and in particular, they provide an ED50 in the physostigmine-induced lethality test of greater than 320.	Compound A was also tested to assess its sedative effects in another procedure:	Acute behavioral, neurologic and autonomic effects of Compound A were evaluated in mice by a modification of the method of Irwin [Irwin S., Drug Screening And Evaluation Of New Drugs In Animals, in Animal And Clinical Pharmacologic Techniques in Drug Evaluation, Nodine JM and Siegler PE (Eds)., Year Book Medical Publishers Inc., Chicago 1964, pp 36-54]. After oral administration of vehicle or drug, mice (CFI males, 20-24 g) were observed and manipulated to evaluate behavorial, neurologic and autonomic changes. A semiquantitative scoring scale was used where signs normally present (e.g., spontaneous activity, alertness, pupil size) were assigned a "normal" score of 0 and scores of +1, +2 and +3 indicated slight, moderate and marked increases and scores of -1, -2 and -3 indicated slight, moderate and marked decreases from "normality". When a sign occurred that is not normally present (e.g., convulsions, tremors), its magnitude was graded on a 1-3 scale. Each treatment group consisted of 6 animals and evaluations were conducted 1 hour after dosing. Additional observations for lethality were made for up to 24 hours after dosing. Incidence is defined as the observation occurring in an animal with a score of 2 or greater according to the scoring method defined above.	______________________________________	Effects of Compound A on behavior, neurologic function and automatic function in mice Measurement MED, mg/kg poa	______________________________________	Lethality 300	Reactivity 300	Decreased motor activity	300	Decreased muscle tone	300	Tremors/convulsions	300	Ataxia 300	Mydriasis 300	Ptosis 300	______________________________________	a Minimal effective dose, defined as the lowest dose that produced a score of 2 or greater according to Irwin (supra) in at least 3 of 6 animals tested at each dose.	From the above test results, it may be concluded that the compounds of the invention would be essentially non-sedating at a clinically useful antihistamic dosage. Compound B (i.e., the 8-fluoro compound) is particularly preferred because it has also shown very low toxicity.	The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptom being treated. A typical recommended dosage regimen is oral administration of from 5 to 100 mg/day, preferably 10 to 20 mg/day, in two to four divided doses to achieve relief of the symptoms.	The following examples are intended to illustrate, but not to limit, the present invention.	EXAMPLE I	A.	N-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-3-methyl-2-pyridine carboxamide	2-cyano-3-methyl pyridine (400 g) is suspended in t-BuOH (800 mL) and the mixture heated to 70° C. Concentrated sulphuric acid (400 mL) is added dropwise over 45 minutes. The reaction is complete after a further 30 minutes at 75° C. The mixture is then diluted with water (400 mL), charged with toluene (600 mL) and brought to pH 10 with concentrated aqueous ammonia. The temperature is kept at 50°-55° C. during the work up. The toluene phase is separated, the aqueous layer reextracted and the combined toluene phases are washed with water. Removal of the toluene yields an oil, N-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-methyl-2-pyridine carboxamide, from which solid product may crystallize. Product yield of 97% is determined by internal standard assay on gas chromatograph.	B.	3-[2-(3-Fluorophenyl)ethyl]-N-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-pyridine carboxamide	Tetrahydrofuran (125 mL) and N-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-methyl-2-pyridine carboxamide (1 equivalent) are charged and cooled to -40° C. under nitrogen. Two equivalents of n-butyllithium are then added over 40 minutes. When half the n-butyllithium is added the mixture turns purple. Sodium bromide (1.3 g) is added and then 3-fluoro-benzyl bromide (1.05 equivalents) is added dropwise (1:1 solution in tetrahydrofuran) over 40-50 minutes while the temperature is maintained at -40° C. After 30 minutes at -40° C., the mixture is diluted with water (250 mL) and the organic phase separated. This phase is dried over sodium sulphate and the solvent removed yielding an oil from which solid product, 3-[2-(3-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-N-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-pyridine carboxamide, may crystallize.	C.	3-[2-(3-Fluorophenyl)ethyl]-2-pyridine-carbonitrile	A solution of 3-[2-(3-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-N-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-pyridine carboxamide (36.4 g, 0.121 mole) in 123 mL (202.3 g, 1.32 mole) of phosphorous oxychloride is heated at 110° C. for 3.5 hours and stirred at ambient temperature an additional 15 hours. The reaction is quenched with ice and water and the pH of the solution is brought to 8 by the addition of a saturated aqueous solution of potassium carbonate. The product is extracted into ethyl acetate and the solution is concentrated to a residue. Following purification by silica gel chromatography and trituration with pentane, 16.2 g (0.072 mole) of product is obtained in 60% yield.	D.	(1-Methyl-4-piperidinyl)[3-[2-(3-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-2-pyridinyl]methanone	To a solution of 3-[2-(3-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-2-pyridine carbonitrile (28.0 g, 0.123 mole) in 150 mL of dry THF is added 92 mL (1.48 moles/liter, 0.136 mole) of N-methylpiperidyl magnesium chloride over 10 minutes maintaining the temperature of 45°-50° C. The reaction is maintained at 40° C. to 50° C. for another 10 minutes and at ambient temperature for 45 minutes. The reaction is quenched to below pH 2 and aqueous hydrochloric acid and the resulting solution is stirred at 25° C. for 1 hour. The pH of the solution is adjusted to about 8, the product is extracted with ethylacetate, and the solution is concentrated to a residue. Following purification by silica gel chromatography, 38.3 g of product is obtained as a brown oil.	E.	8-Fluoro-11-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo[5,6]cyclohepta[1,2-b]pyridine 	A solution of (1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)[3-[2-(3-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-2-piperidinyl]methano ne (15.0 g, 0.046 mole) in 74 mL (125.5 g, 0.837 mole) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is stirred at ambient temperature for 18 hours. The reaction is quenched with ice-water and the solution made basic with potassium hydroxide. The product is extracted into ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate solution is filtered to remove insolubles and the filtrate is concentrated to a residue. Following purification by silica gel chromatography, 5.4 g (0.0175 mole) of product is obtained in 38% yield.	F.	8-Fluoro-11(1-ethoxycarbonyl-4-piperidylidene)-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo[5,6]cyclohepta[1,2-b]pyridine 	To a stirred solution of 8-fluoro-11-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo[5,6]cyclohep ta[1,2-b]pyridine (10.5 g, 34 mmol) and triethylamine (5.2 g, 52 mmol) in dry toluene (120 mL) at 80° C. under an argon atmosphere, was added ethylchloroformate (18.5 g, 170 mmol) via a syringe.

Description:	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	During the past decade, the relationship between monoamine uptake and a variety of diseases and conditions has been appreciated and investigated. For example, the hydrochloride salt of fluoxetine (dl-N-methyl-γ-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]benzenepropanamine) is a selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) uptake inhibitor presently undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of depression, anxiety, appetite suppression, and other disorders. Similarly, tomoxetine hydrochloride ((-)-N-methyl-δ-(2-methylphenoxy)benzenepropanamine hydrochloride) is a selective inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake being investigated clinically for its antidepressant activity. These compounds are among many taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,018,895, 4,194,009, and 4,314,081 as being potent but selective blockers of the uptake of a particular monoamine.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	The present invention provides novel 3-aryloxy-3-substituted propanamines which are potent inhibitors of both serotonin and norepinephrine uptake. More specifically, the present invention relates to a compound of the formula ##STR1## wherein:	R1 is C5 -C7 cycloalkyl, thienyl, halothienyl, (C1 -C4 alkyl)thienyl, furanyl, pyridyl or thiazolyl; ##STR2## each of R2 and R3 independently is hydrogen or methyl; each R4 independently is halo, C1 -C4 alkyl, C1 -C3 alkoxy or trifluoromethyl;	each R5 independently is halo, C1 -C4 alkyl or trifluoromethyl;	m is 0, 1 or 2;	n is 0 or 1; and	the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.	The invention also provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a compound of the above formula and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient therefor.	A further embodiment of the invention are methods for selectively inhibiting the uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, as well as for treating a variety of disorders which have been linked to decreased neurotransmission of serotonin and norepinephrine in mammals including obesity, depression, alcoholism, pain, loss of memory, anxiety, smoking, and the like, employing a compound of the invention.	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION	
US5023269_0002	In the above formula, the term C1 -C4 alkyl represents a straight or branched alkyl chain bearing from one to four carbon atoms. Typical C1 -C4 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec.-butyl and t-butyl.	C1 -C3 Alkoxy represents methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy or isopropoxy.	Halo represents fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo.	When Ar is naphthalenyl, it can be either 1-naphthalenyl or 2-naphthalenyl.	When R1 is thienyl, it can be either 2-thienyl or 3-thienyl; when R1 is furanyl, it can be either 2-furanyl or 3-furanyl; when R' is pyridyl, it can be either 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl or 4-pyridyl; when R1 is thiazolyl, it can be either 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl or 5-thiazolyl.	(C1 -C4 Alkyl)thienyl represents a thienyl ring monosubstituted with a C1 -C4 alkyl substituent. Typical C1 -C4 alkyl)thienyl groups include 4-methyl-2-thienyl, 3-ethyl-2-thienyl, 2-methyl-3-thienyl, 4-propyl-3-thienyl, 5-n-butyl-2-thienyl, 4-methyl-3-thienyl, 3-methyl-2thienyl, and the like.	Halothienyl represents a thienyl ring monosubstituted with a halo substituent. Typical halo-thienyl groups include 3-chloro-2-thienyl, 4-bromo-3-thienyl, 2-iodo-3-thienyl, 5-iodo-3-thienyl, 4-fluoro-2-thienyl, 2-bromo-3-thienyl, 4-chloro-2-thienyl and the like.	While all of the compounds of the present invention are believed to inhibit the uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in mammals, there are certain of these compounds which are preferred for such uses. Preferably, R1 is halothienyl, (C1 -C4 alkyl)thienyl and especially thienyl. Further, one of R2 and R3 is hydrogen and the other is methyl. It is also preferred that those compounds wherein both R2 and R3 are other than methyl are preferred for inhibiting the uptake of norepinephrine in mammals. Other preferred aspects of the present invention will be noted hereinafter.	The compounds of the present invention possess an asymmetric carbon represented by the carbon atom labeled "C" in the following formula: ##STR3## As such, the compounds can exist as the individual stereoisomers as well as the racemic mixture. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention will include not only the dl-racemates, but also their respective optically active d- and l-isomers.	As pointed out above, the invention includes the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds defined by the above formula. Since the compounds of this invention are amines, they are basic in nature and accordingly react with any number of inorganic and organic acids to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Since the free amines of the invention are typically oils at room temperature, it is preferable to convert the free amines to their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, which are routinely solid at room temperature, for ease of handling. Acids commonly employed to form such salts include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid, as well as organic acids such as para-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, oxalic, para-bromophenylsulfonic, carbonic, succinic, citric, benzoic and acetic acid, and related inorganic and organic acids. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne-1,4-dioate, hexyne-1,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephathalate, sulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, β-hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, maleate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate and the like salts. Preferred pharmaceutically aoceptable acid addition salts include those formed with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, and especially those formed with organic acids such oxalic acid and maleic acid.

US5023269_0003	N,N-Dimethyl-3-(3-methyl-5-bromophenoxy)-3-(3-thienyl)propanamine	N-Methyl-3-(3-n-propylphenoxy)-3-(2-thienyl)propanamine hydrochloride	N-Methyl-3-(phenoxy)-3-(3-thienyl)propanamine phosphate	N-Methyl-3-(4-methoxyphenoxy)-3-(cycloheptyl) propanamine citrate	3-(2-Chlorophenoxy)-3-(5-thiazolyl)propanamine propionate	3-2-Chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-3-(3-thienyl)propanamine oxalate	3-(Phenoxy)-3-(4-methyl-2-thienyl)propanamine	N,N-Dimethyl-3-(4-ethylphenoxy)-3-(3-pyridyl)propanamine maleate	N,N-Dimethyl-3-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-3-(2-pyridyl)propanamine	The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by procedures well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The compounds are preferably synthesized by treating an hydroxy intermediate with an alkali metal hydride to form the corresponding alkali metal salt, which is then reacted with an appropriate compound containing a good leaving group to provide the corresponding 3-aryloxy-3-substituted propanamine of the invention. This reaction may be represented by the following scheme: ##STR4## wherein M is an alkali metal, R1, R2, R3 and Ar are as defined above, and one of X and Y is hydroxy and the other is a good leaving group such as p-toluenesulfonyl, methanesulfonyl, triphenylphosphine oxide, halo and the like. Preferably X is hydroxy and Y is halo.	This reaction is carried out by combining approximately equimolar quantities to a slight excess of the alkali metal hydride with the alcohol to provide the corresponding alkali metal salt. Typical alkali metal hydrides include sodium hydride and potassium hydride. The compound is then reacted with an equimolar quantity to slight excess of the compound having the good leaving group. The reaction is conducted in a suitable aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylacetamide and related solvents. The reaction is substantially complete after about 10 minutes to about 24 hours when conducted at a temperature in the range of about 25° C. to about 150° C. More preferably, the reaction mixture will be complete within about 30 minutes to about 6 hours when conducted at a temperature in the range of about 75° C. to about 125° C. The product may be isolated by standard conditions as well. Typically, the mixture is diluted with water and extracted with a water immiscible organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, chloroform and the like. The organic extracts are typically combined and dried. Following evaporation of the organic solvent the isolated residue may be further purified, if desired, by standard techniques such as crystallization from common solvents, or chromatography over solid supports such as silica gel or alumina.	The compounds of the present invention wherein one of R2 and R3 is hydrogen and the other is methyl are preferably prepared by demethylating the corresponding N,N-dimethylpropanamine. Preferably, a reagent such a phenyl chloroformate or trichloroethyl chloroformate is reacted with the N,N-dimethylpropanamine to provide the corresponding intermediate, which is then hydrolyzed in base to provide the corresponding N-methylpropanamine.	As noted above, the optically active isomers of the racemates of the invention are also considered part of this invention. Such optically active isomers may be prepared from their respective optically active precursors by the procedures described above, or by resolving the racemic mixtures. This resolution can be carried out in the presence of a resolving agent, by chromatography or by repeated crystallization. Particularly useful resolving agents include dibenzoyl-d- and -1-tartaric acids and the like.	The compounds employed as starting materials in the synthesis of the compounds of the invention are also prepared by standard procedures. Preferably, standard Mannich reaction conditions are employed to synthesize the corresponding Mannich Base from the appropriate ketone, formaldehyde and dimethylamine, which is then reduced with a hydride reducing agent, such as sodium brohydride, employing standard reduction conditions. The analogs containing the leaving group are also prepared by known procedures or are commercially available from various organic laboratories.	The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the invention are typically formed by reacting a 3-aryloxy-3-substituted propanamine of the invention with an equimolar or excess amount of acid. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethyl ether or benzene, and the salt normally precipitates out of solution within about one hour to 10 days, and can be isolated by filtration.

The Examples are not intended to be limiting to the scope of the invention in any respect and should not be so construed.

As noted above, the compounds of this invention are useful for inhibiting the uptake of serotonin. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention is a method for inhibiting serotonin uptake in mammals which comprises administering to a mammal requiring increased neurotransmission of serotonin a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of the invention.	Compounds of the invention also have the ability to inhibit the uptake of norepinephrine. As such, yet another embodiment of this invention is a method for inhibiting norepinephrine uptake in mammals which comprises administering to a mammal requiring increased neurotransmission of norepinephrine a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of the invention.	The term "pharmaceutically effective amount", as used herein, represents an amount of a compound of the invention which is capable of inhibiting serotonin or norepinephrine uptake. The particular dose of compound administered according to this invention will of course be determined by the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including the compound administered, the route of administration, the particular condition being treated, and similar considerations. The compounds can be administered by a variety of routes including the oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular or intranasal routes. The compounds of the invention unexpectedly inhibit the uptake of not only serotonin but also norepinephrine in mammals. It is a special feature of the compounds that they have good oral bioavailability without losing their substantial potent inhibiting effect of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake inhibiting effect. It is also a special feature of the compounds of the present invention in that they have been found to demonstrate a low degree of toxicity to mammals. A typical daily dose will contain from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg of the active compound of this invention. Preferred daily doses will be about 0.05 to about 10 mg/kg, ideally about 0.1 to about 5 mg/kg.	A variety of physiologic functions have been shown to be subject to influence by brain serotoninengic and norepinephrinergic neural systems. As such, the compounds of the present invention are believed to have the ability to treat a variety of disorders in mammals associated with these neural systems such as obesity, depression, alcoholism, pain, loss of memory, anxiety and smoking. Therefore, the present invention also provides methods of treating the above disorders at rates set forth above for inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine uptake in mammals.	The following experiment was conducted to demonstrate the ability of the compounds of the present invention to inhibit the uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. This general procedure is set forth by Wong et al., in Drug Development Research 6:397-403 (1985).	Male Sprague-Dawley rats (110-150 g) from Harlan Industries (Cumberland, IN) were fed a Purina Chow ad libitum for at least 3 days before being used in the studies. Rats were killed by decapitation. Whole brains were removed and dissected. Cerebral cortex was homogenized in 9 volumes of a medium containing 0.32 M sucrose and 10 mM glucose. Crude synaptosomal preparations were isolated after differential centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 min. and 17,000 g for 28 min. The final pellets were suspended in the same medium and kept in ice until use within the same day.	Synaptosomal uptake of 3 H-serotonin(3 H-5hydroxytryptamine, 3 H-5HT) and 14 C-l-norepinephrine (14 C-NE) was determined as follows. Cortical synaptosomes (equivalent to 1 mg of protein) were incubated at 37° C. for 5 min in 1 ml of Krebs-bicarbonate medium containing also 10 mM glucose, 0.1 mM iproniazid, 1 mM ascorbic acid, 0.17 mM EDTA, 50 nM 3 H-5HT and 100 nM 14 C-NE The reaction mixture was immediately diluted with 2 ml of ice-chilled Krebs-bicarbonate buffer and filtered under vacuum with a cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD). Filters were rinsed twice with approximately 5 ml of ice-chilled 0.9% saline and were transferred to a counting vial containing 10 ml of scintillation fluid (PCS, Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). Radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. Accumulation of 3 H-5HT and 14 C-NE at 4° C. represented the background and was subtracted from all samples.	The results of the evaluation of various compounds of the present invention are set forth below in Table I. In the Table, columns 1-4 identify the structure of the compounds evaluated when taken with the formula set forth in the heading; column 5 identifies the salt form, if any, of the compound evaluated; and columns 6 and 7 provide the concentration of the test compound at 10-9 M (nM) needed to inhibit 50% of serotonin (5HT) or norepinephrine, respectively, and is indicated in the Table as IC50. The numbers in parentheses represent percent inhibition at 1000 nM.
