[0002] The present invention also relates to a method of treatment of FSD, in particular FSAD.	[0003] The present invention also relates to assays to screen for compounds useful in the treatment of FSD, in particular FSAD.	[0004] For convenience, a list of abbreviations that are used in the following text is presented before the Claims section.	FEMALE SEXUAL RESPONSE	[0005] The female sexual response phase of arousal is not easily distinguished from the phase of desire until physiological changes begin to take place in the vagina and clitoris as well as other sexual organs. Sexual excitement and pleasure are accompanied by a combination of vascular and neuromuscular events which lead to engorgement of the clitoris, labia and vaginal wall, increased vaginal lubrication and dilatation of the vaginal lumen (Levin, 1980; Ottesen, 1983; Levin, 1991; Levin, 1992; Sjoberg, 1992; Wagner, 1992; Schiavi et al., 1995; Masters et al., 1996; Berman et al., 1999).	[0006] Vaginal engorgement enables transudation to occur and this process is responsible for increased vaginal lubrication. Transudation allows a flow of plasma through the epithelium and onto the vaginal surface, the driving force for which is increased blood flow in the vaginal capillary bed during the aroused state. In addition engorgement leads to an increase in vaginal length and luminal diameter, especially in the distal 2/3 of the vaginal canal. The luminal dilatation of the vagina is due to a combination of smooth muscle relaxation of its wall and skeletal muscle relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles. Some sexual pain disorders such as vaginismus are thought to be due, at least in part, by inadequate relaxation preventing dilatation of the vagina; it has yet to be ascertained if this is primarily a smooth or skeletal muscle problem. (Levin, 1980; Ottesen, 1983; Levin, 1991; Levin, 1992; Sjoberg, 1992; Wagner, 1992; Schiavi et al., 1995; Master et al., 1996; Berman et al., 1999).	[0007] The vasculature and micro vasculature of the vagina are innervated by nerves containing neuropeptides and other neurotransmitter candidates. These include calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (Hoyle et al., 1996). Peptides that are present in the clitoris are discussed infra. Nitric oxide synthase, which is often colocalised with VIP, displays a greater expression, immunologically, in the deep arteries and veins rather than in the blood vessels of the propria (Hoyle et al., 1996).	FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION	[0008] It is known that some individuals can suffer from female sexual dysfunction (FSD).	[0009] FSD is best defined as the difficulty or inability of a woman to find satisfaction in sexual expression. FSD is a collective term for several diverse female sexual disorders (Leiblum, 1998, Berman et al., 1999). The woman may have lack of desire, difficulty with arousal or orgasm, pain with intercourse or a combination of these problems. Several types of disease, medications, injuries or psychological problems can cause FSD.	[0010] Studies investigating sexual dysfunction in couples reveals that up to 76% of women have complaints of sexual dysfunction and that 30-50% of women in the USA experience FSD.	[0011] Sub-types of FSD include hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorder and sexual desire disorder.	[0012] Treatments in development are targeted to treat specific subtypes of FSD, predominantly desire and arousal disorders.	[0013] The categories of FSD are best defined by contrasting them to the phases of normal female sexual response: desire, arousal and orgasm (Leiblum 1998). Desire or libido is the drive for sexual expression - and manifestations often include sexual thoughts either when in the company of an interested partner or when exposed to other erotic stimuli. In contrast, sexual arousal is the vascular response to sexual stimulation, an important component of which is vaginal lubrication and elongation of the vagina. Thus, sexual arousal, in contrast to sexual desire, is a response relating to genital (e.g. vaginal and clitoral) blood flow and not necessarily sensitivity. Orgasm is the release of sexual tension that has culminated during arousal. Hence, FSD typically occurs when a woman has an inadequate or unsatisfactory response in any of these phases, usually desire, arousal or orgasm. FSD categories include hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorders and sexual pain disorders.	[0014] Hypoactive sexual desire disorder is present if a woman has no or little desire to be sexual, and has no or few sexual thoughts or fantasies. This type of FSD can be caused by low testosterone levels, due either to natural menopause or to surgical menopause. Other causes include illness, medications, fatigue, depression and anxiety.	[0015] Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is characterised by inadequate genital response to sexual stimulation. The genitalia (e.g. the vagina and/or the clitoris) do not undergo the engorgement that characterises normal sexual arousal. The vaginal walls are poorly lubricated, so that intercourse is painful. Orgasms may be impeded. Arousal disorder can be caused by reduced oestrogen at menopause or after childbirth and during lactation, as well as by illnesses, with vascular components such as diabetes and atherosclerosis. Other causes result from treatment with diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants eg SSRIs or antihypertensive agents. FSAD is discussed in more detail infra.	[0016] Sexual pain disorders (which include dyspareunia and vaginismus) are characterised by pain resulting from penetration and may be caused by medications which reduce lubrication, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammatory bowel disease or urinary tract problems.	[0017] The prevalence of FSD is difficult to gauge because the term covers several types of problem, some of which are difficult to measure, and because the interest in treating FSD is relatively recent. Many women's sexual problems are associated either directly with the female ageing process or with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension.	[0018] There are wide variations in the reported incidence and prevalence of FSD, in part explained by the use of differing evaluation criteria, but most investigators report that a significant proportion of otherwise healthy women have symptoms of one or more of the FSD subgroups. By way of example, studies comparing sexual dysfunction in couples reveal that 63% of women had arousal or orgasmic dysfunction compared with 40% of men have erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction (Frank et al., 1978).	[0019] However, the prevalence of female sexual arousal disorder varies considerably from survey to survey. In a recent National Health and Social Life Survey 19% of women reported lubrication difficulties whereas 14% of women in an outpatient gynaecological clinic reported similar difficulties with lubrication (Rosen et al., 1993).	[0020] Several studies have also reported dysfunction with sexual arousal in diabetic women (up to 47%), this included reduced vaginal lubrication (Wincze et al., 1993). There was no association between neuropathy and sexual dysfunction.	[0021] Numerous studies have also shown that between 11-48% of women overall may have reduced sexual desire with age. Similarly, between 11-50% of women report problems with arousal and lubrication, and therefore experience pain with intercourse. Vaginismus is far less common, affecting approximately 1% of women.	[0022] Studies of sexually experienced women have detailed that 5-10% have primary anorgasmia. Another 10% have infrequent orgasms and a further 10% experience them inconsistently (Spector et al., 1990).	[0023] Because FSD consists of several subtypes that express symptoms in separate phases of the sexual response cycle, there is not a single therapy. Current treatment of FSD focuses principally on psychological or relationship issues. Treatment of FSD is gradually evolving as more clinical and basic science studies are dedicated to the investigation of this medical problem. Female sexual complaints are not all psychological in pathophysiology, especially for those individuals who may have a component of vasculogenic dysfunction (eg FSAD) contributing to the overall female sexual complaint. There are at present no drugs licensed for the treatment of FSD. Empirical drug therapy includes oestrogen administration (topically or as hormone replacement therapy), androgens or mood-altering drugs such as buspirone or trazodone. These treatment options are often unsatisfactory due to low efficacy or unacceptable side effects.	[0024] Since interest is relatively recent in treating FSD pharmacologically, therapy consists of the following:- psychological counselling, over-the-counter sexual lubricants, and investigational candidates, including drugs approved for other conditions. These medications consist of hormonal agents, either testosterone or combinations of oestrogen and testosterone and more recently vascular drugs, that have proved effective in male erectile dysfunction. None of these agents has been demonstrated to be very effective in treating FSD.	FEMALE SEXUAL AROUSAL DISORDER (FSAD)	[0025] The sexual arousal response consists of vasocongestion in the pelvis, vaginal lubrication and expansion and swelling of the external genitalia. The disturbance causes marked distress and/or interpersonal difficulty. Studies investigating sexual dysfunction in couples reveals that there is a large number of females who suffer from sexual arousal dysfunction; otherwise known as female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD).	[0026] The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV of the American Psychiatric Association defines Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD) as being:	"a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement. The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. "	[0027] FSAD is a highly prevalent sexual disorder affecting pre-, peri- and post menopausal (+/-HRT) women. It is associated with concomitant disorders such as depression, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and UG disorders.	[0028] The primary consequences of FSAD are lack of engorgement/swelling, lack of lubrication and lack of pleasurable genital sensation. The secondary consequences of FSAD are reduced sexual desire, pain during intercourse and difficulty in achieving an orgasm.	[0029] It has recently been hypothesised that there is a vascular basis for at least a proportion of patients with symptoms of FSAD (Goldstein et al., 1998) with animal data supporting this view (Park et al., 1997).	[0030] Drug candidates for treating FSAD, which are under investigation for efficacy, are primarily erectile dysfunction therapies that promote circulation to the male genitalia. They consist of two types of formulation, oral or sublingual medications (Apomorphine, Phentolamine, Sildenafil), and prostaglandin (PGE1 - Alprostadil) that are injected or administered transurethrally in men, and topically to the genitalia in women.	[0031] The present invention seeks to provide an effective means of treating FSD, and in particular FSAD.	SUMMARY ASPECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION	[0032] A seminal finding of the present invention is the ability to treat a female suffering from FSD (preferably FSAD) with use of an I:NEP.	[0033] In accordance with the present invention, the I:NEP of the present invention is referred to as the "agent of the present invention".	[0034] The agent of the present invention may also be used in combination with one or more additional pharmaceutically active agents. The additional pharmaceutically active agent, if either present or used in conjunction with the agent of the present invention, may be referred to as an "additional agent". One or more of these additional agents may be one or more of: I:PDE, another I:NEP, an I:NPY. Combinations of agents are discussed in more detail below.	
EP1481667_0002	[0035] If the additional agent of the present invention is an I:PDE then for some embodiments said PDE is a cAMP hydrolysing PDE (and optionally cGMP hydrolysing). The term "hydrolysing cAMP" also includes metabolising and/or breaking down cAMP. The term "hydrolysing cAMP (and optionally cGMP)" means that the additional agent may be able to hydrolyse cGMP in addition to cAMP. Here, the term "hydrolyse cGMP" also includes metabolising and/or breaking down cGMP. However, for some embodiments of the present invention, it is to be understood that the additional agent need not necessarily be able to hydrolyse cGMP.	[0036] General references herein to agents may be applicable to additional agents as well as to agents of the present invention.	[0037] In accordance with the present invention, the agent of the present invention acts on a target, preferably specifically on that target. This target is sometimes referred to as the "target of the present invention". However, the agent of the present invention may act on one or more other targets. These other targets may be referred to as an "additional target". Likewise, if an additional agent is used, then that additional agent can target the same target of the present invention and/or an additional target (which need not be the same additional target that is acted on by the agent of the present invention). Targets are described herein. It is to be understood that general references herein to targets may be applicable to the additional targets as well as to the target of the present invention.	[0038] A further seminal finding of the present invention is the ability to enhance female genital (e.g. vaginal or clitoral) blood flow with use of the agent of the present invention.	[0039] In our experiments we have found that FSAD is associated with reduced genital blood flow - in particular reduced blood flow in the vagina and/or the clitoris. Hence, treatment of women with FSAD can be achieved by enhancement of genital blood flow with vasoactive agents. In our studies, we have shown that cAMP mediates vaginal and clitoral vasorelaxation and that genital (e.g. vaginal and clitoral) blood flow can be enhanced/potentiated by elevation of cAMP levels. This is a further seminal finding.	[0040] In this respect, no one has previously proposed that FSAD can be treated in such a way - i.e. by direct or indirect elevation of cAMP levels. Moreover, there are no teachings in the art to suggest that FSAD was associated with a detrimental modulation of cAMP activity and/or levels or that cAMP is responsible for mediating vaginal and clitoral vasorelaxation. Hence, the present invention is even further surprising.	[0041] In addition, we have found that by using agents of the present invention it is possible to increase genital engorgement and treat FSAD- e.g. increased lubrication in the vagina and increased sensitivity in the vagina and clitoris.	[0042] Thus, in a broad aspect, the present invention relates to the use of a cAMP potentiator to treat FSD, in particular FSAD.	[0043] The present invention is advantageous as it provides a means for restoring a normal sexual arousal response - namely increased genital blood flow leading to vaginal, clitoral and labial engorgement. This will result in increased vaginal lubrication via plasma transudation, increased vaginal compliance and increased genital (e.g. vaginal and clitoral) sensitivity. Hence, the present invention provides a means to restore, or potentiate, the normal sexual arousal response.

These steps may be repeated until the desired activity or pharmacokinetic profile has been achieved.	[0052] Thus, in a further aspect, the present invention relates to a process comprising the steps of: (a1) performing the assay according to the present invention; (b1) identifying one or more agents that can directly or indirectly potentiate cAMP activity, (b2) modifiying one or more of said identified agents; (a2) optionally repeating step (a1); and (c) preparing a quantity of those one or more identified agents (i.e. those that have been modified); and wherein said agent is an I:NEP.

[0085] For some applications, preferably the additional agent is a selective I:NPY.	[0086] For some applications, preferably the additional agent is an I:NPY Y1.	[0087] For some applications, preferably the additional agent is a selective I:NPY Y1.	[0088] For some applications, the agent does not cause - or is administered in such a fashion so that it does not cause - a prolonged drop in blood pressure (e.g. over a period of about 5 minutes or more). In this embodiment, if the agent is to be delivered topically then that agent may have the ability to cause a drop in blood pressure (such as if it were to be delivered intraveneously), provided that in the topical application minimal levels of the agent pass into the blood stream. For an oral agent, it is preferred that the agent does not cause a prolonged drop in blood pressure.	[0089] In a preferred aspect, the agent of the present invention does not cause - or is administered in such a fashion so that it does not cause - a large change in heart rate.	TREATMENT	[0090] It is to be appreciated that all references herein to treatment include one or more of curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment. Preferably, the term treatment includes at least curative treatment and/or palliative tretament.	FEMALE GENITALIA	[0091] The term "female genitalia" is used in accordance with the definition provided in Gray's Anatomy, C.D. Clemente, 13th American Edition - viz:	"The genital organs consist of an internal and external group. The internal organs are situated within the pelvis and consist of ovaries, the uterine tubes, uterus and the vagina. The external organs are superficial to the urogenital diaphragm and below the pelvic arch. They comprise the mons pubis, the labia majora and minora pudendi, the clitoris, the vestibule, the bulb of the vestibule, and the greater vestibular glands".	ENDOGENOUS cAMP	[0092] In a highly preferred embodiment the agent of the present invention potentiates endogenous cAMP - such as potentiates endogenous cAMP levels.	[0093] Here, the term "endogenous cAMP" means cAMP that arises from sexual stimulation (sexual arousal). Hence, the term does not encompass cAMP levels that will be elevated independent of sexual drive.	[0094] Thus, according to the present invention, treatment of FSAD is achieved by directly or indirectly potentiating endogenous cAMP signalling which, in turn, increases vaginal blood flow/lubrication and/or clitoral blood flow; thus enhancing the natural sexual arousal response. Thus, the treatment method of the present invention restores or potentiates the normal arousal response.	[0095] In the treatment method of the present invention, this result may be achieved by use of an inhibitor of NEP (EC 3.4.24.11).	[0096] An animal test model is provided herein. This animal test model may be used to determine increases of genital blood flow as a result of cAMP potentiation. In this animal model a pelvic nerve is stimulated - which brings on an effect that mimics the physiology of a sexual arousal/response. In these experiments, agents according to the present invention cause an increase in blood flow, above control increases, after the nerve has been stimulated. In the absence of stimulation, the agents have no (or a negligible) effect in causing an increase in blood flow. Typically, in these experiments, the nerve is stimulated in order to obtain a base line increase in blood flow. Then a candidate (or actual) agent is delivered to the animal systemically or locally, such as by the intravenous, topical or oral route. An increase in blood flow, compared to control increases, is then indicative of an agent according to the present invention..	SEXUAL STIMULATION	[0097] The present invention also encompasses administration of the agent of the present invention before and/or during sexual stimulation. Here the term "sexual stimulation" may be synonymous with the term "sexual arousal". This aspect of the present invention is advantageous because it provides systemic selectivity. The natural cascade only occurs at the genitalia and not in other locations - e.g. in the heart etc. Hence, it would be possible to achieve a selective effect on the genitalia.	[0098] Thus, for some aspects of the present invention it is highly desirable that there is a sexual stimulation step. We have found that this step can provide systemic selectivity. Here, "sexual stimulation" may be one or more of a visual stimulation, a physical stimulation, an auditory stimulation, or a thought stimulation.	[0099] Thus, preferably the agents of the present invention are delivered before or during sexual stimulation, particulaly when those agents are for oral delivery.	[0100] Hence, for this preferred aspect, the present invention provides for the use of an agent of the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of FSAD; wherein the agent is capable of potentiating cAMP in the sexual genitalia of a female suffering from FSAD; and wherein said female is sexually stimulated before or during administration of said medicament.	[0101] Preferably, the present invention provides for the use of an agent of the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of FSAD; wherein the agent is capable of potentiating cAMP in the sexual genitalia of a female suffering from FSAD; wherein said female is sexually stimulated before or during administration of said medicament; and wherein said medicament is delivered orally to said female.	[0102] In addition, for this preferred aspect, the present invention provides for a method of treating a female suffering from FSAD; the method comprising delivering to the female an agent of the present invention that is capable of potentiating cAMP in the sexual genitalia; wherein the agent is in an amount to cause potentiation of cAMP in the sexual genitalia of the female; wherein the agent is optionally admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient; and wherein said female is sexually stimulated before or during administration of said agent.	[0103] Preferably, the present invention provides for a method of treating a female suffering from FSAD; the method comprising delivering to the female an agent of the present invention that is capable of potentiating cAMP in the sexual genitalia; wherein the agent is in an amount to cause potentiation of cAMP in the sexual genitalia of the female; wherein the agent is optionally admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient; wherein said female is sexually stimulated before or during administration of said agent; and wherein said agent is delivered orally to said female.	POTENTIATING cAMP	[0104] As used herein with reference to cAMP, the term "potentiating" includes any one or more of: increasing the effectiveness of cAMP, increasing the levels of cAMP, increasing the activity of cAMP, decreasing the level of cAMP degradation, decreasing the level of cAMP inhibition.	[0105] The potentiating effect can be a direct effect. An example of a direct effect would be upregulation of cAMP levels by an agent that increases the expression thereof.	[0106] Alternatively, the potentiating effect could be an indirect effect. An example of such an effect would be action on a substance that would otherwise inhibit and/or reduce the levels and/or activity of cAMP. Another example of such an effect would be increasing the action of a substance that increases the effectiveness of cAMP, increases the levels of cAMP, increases the activity of cAMP, decreases the level of cAMP degradation, or decreases the level of cAMP inhibition.	[0107] An example of an additional agent that could act as a PcAMP would be I:PDE, such as I:PDEII.	cAMP Mimetic	[0108] For some aspects of the present invention, the additional agent may act as a cAMP mimetic.	[0109] As used herein, the term "cAMP mimetic" means an agent that can act in a similar fashion (e.g. have a similar biological profile and effect) to cAMP in the female sexual genitalia and, in doing so, does any one or more of: increases the effectiveness of cAMP like moieties, increases the levels of cAMP like moieties, increases the activity of cAMP like moieties, decreases the level of degradation of cAMP like moieties, decreases the level of inhibition of cAMP like moieties.	[0110] An example of a cAMP mimetic would be forskolin. Here we have found that forskolin increases vaginal and clitoral blood flow and it can also act as a vaginal relaxant.	[0111] In a preferred aspect, the cAMP mimetic is administered orally.	ACTIVATOR OF cAMP	[0112] As used herein, the term "activator of cAMP" means a substance that controls or releases cAMP in the female sexual genitalia. The control may be direct (e.g. on cAMP itself) or indirect (e.g. via activation of cAMP). For ease of reference, we refer to these substances as AcAMP.	TARGET	[0113] The term "target" as used herein with reference to the present invention means any substance that is cAMP, an AcAMP, an IcAMP, or an AMcAMP. Otherwise expressed, the target of the present invention can be referred to as a PcAMP target.	[0114] The target of the present invention and/or the additional target may be an amino acid sequence and/or a nucleotide sequence encoding same and/or an expression unit responsible for the expression of same and/or a modulator of same.	[0115] The target may even be a combination of such targets.	AGENT	[0116] The agent of the present invention may be any suitable agent that can act as a PcAMP.	[0117] The agent (i.e. the agent of the present invention and/or the additional agent) can be an amino acid sequence or a chemical derivative thereof. The substance may even be an organic compound or other chemical. The agent may even be a nucleotide sequence - which may be a sense sequence or an anti-sense sequence. The agent may even be an antibody.	[0118] Thus, the term "agent" includes, but is not limited to, a compound which may be obtainable from or produced by any suitable source, whether natural or not.	[0119] The agent may be designed or obtained from a library of compounds which may comprise peptides, as well as other compounds, such as small organic molecules, such as lead compounds.	[0120] By way of example, the agent may be a natural substance, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials such as bacteria, fungi, or animal (particularly mammalian) cells or tissues, an organic or an inorganic molecule, a synthetic agent, a semi-synthetic agent, a structural or functional mimetic, a peptide, a peptidomimetics, a derivatised agent, a peptide cleaved from a whole protein, or a peptides synthesised synthetically (such as, by way of example, either using a peptide synthesizer or by recombinant techniques or combinations thereof, a recombinant agent, an antibody, a natural or a non-natural agent, a fusion protein or equivalent thereof and mutants, derivatives or combinations thereof.	[0121] As used herein, the term "agent" may be a single entity or it may be a combination of agents.	[0122] If the agent is an organic compound then for some applications - such as if the agent is an I:NEP - that organic compound may typically comprise an amide group (i.e. - N(H)-C(O)- or even -C(O)-N(H)-) and one or more hydrocarbyl groups. Here, the term "hydrocarbyl group" means a group comprising at least C and H and may optionally comprise one or more other suitable substituents. Examples of such substituents may include halo-, alkoxy-, nitro-, an alkyl group, a cyclic group etc. In addition to the possibility of the substituents being a cyclic group, a combination of substituents may form a cyclic group. If the hydrocarbyl group comprises more than one C then those carbons need not necessarily be linked to each other. For example, at least two of the carbons may be linked via a suitable element or group. Thus, the hydrocarbyl group may contain hetero atoms. Suitable hetero atoms will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include, for instance, sulphur, nitrogen and oxygen. For some applications, preferably the agent comprises at least one cyclic group. For some applications, preferably the agent comprises at least one cyclic group linked to another hydrocarbyl group via an amide bond. Examples of such compounds are presented in the Examples section herein.	
EP1481667_0004	[0123] If the agent is an organic compound then for some applications - such as if the agent is an I:PDE - that organic compound may typically comprise two or more linked hydrocarbyl groups. For some applications, preferably the agent comprises at least two cyclic groups - wherein one of which cyclic groups may be a fused cyclic ring structure. For some applications, preferably at least one of the cyclic groups is a heterocyclic group. For some applications, preferably the heterocyclic group comprises at least one N in the ring. Examples of such compounds are presented in the Examples section herein.	[0124] If the agent is an organic compound then for some applications - such as if the agent is an I:NPY - that organic compound may typically comprise two or more linked hydrocarbyl groups. For some applications, preferably the agent comprises at least two cyclic groups - optionally wherein one of which cyclic groups may be a fused cyclic ring structure. For some applications, at least one of the cyclic groups is a heterocyclic group. For some applications, preferably the heterocyclic group comprises at least one N in the ring. Examples of such compounds are presented in the Examples section herein.	[0125] The agent may contain halo groups. Here, "halo" means fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo.	[0126] The agent may contain one or more of alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, alkylene and alkenylene groups - which may be unbranched- or branched-chain.	[0127] The agent may be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt - such as an acid addition salt or a base salt - or a solvate thereof, including a hydrate thereof. For a review on suitable salts see Berge et al, J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19.	[0128] Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts and examples are the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate, nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, maleate, fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, gluconate, succinate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulphonate, ethanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-toluenesulphonate and pamoate salts.	[0129] Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts and examples are the sodium, potassium, aluminium, calcium, magnesium, zinc and diethanolamine salts.	[0130] A pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an agent of the present invention may be readily prepared by mixing together solutions of the agent and the desired acid or base, as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent.	[0131] The agent may exisit in polymorphic form.	[0132] The agent may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and therefore exists in two or more stereoisomeric forms. Where an agent contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, cis (E) and trans (Z) isomerism may also occur. The present invention includes the individual stereoisomers of the agent and, where appropriate, the individual tautomeric forms thereof, together with mixtures thereof.	[0133] Separation of diastereoisomers or cis and trans isomers may be achieved by conventional techniques, e.g. by fractional crystallisation, chromatography or H.P.L.C. of a stereoisomeric mixture of the agent or a suitable salt or derivative thereof. An individual enantiomer of the agent may also be prepared from a corresponding optically pure intermediate or by resolution, such as by H.P.L.C. of the corresponding racemate using a suitable chiral support or by fractional crystallisation of the diastereoisomeric salts formed by reaction of the corresponding racemate with a suitable optically active acid or base, as appropriate.	[0134] The present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of an agent of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as <2>H, <3>H, <13>C, <14>C, <15>N, <17>O, <18>O, <31>P, <32>P, <35>S, <18>F and <36>Cl, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as <3>H or <14>C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., <3>H, and carbon-14, i.e., <14>C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., <2>H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopic variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.	[0135] It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the agent may be derived from a prodrug. Examples of prodrugs include entities that have certain protected group(s) and which may not possess pharmacological activity as such, but may, in certain instances, be administered (such as orally or parenterally) and thereafter metabolised in the body to form the agent which are pharmacologically active.	[0136] It will be further appreciated that certain moieties known as "pro-moieties", for example as described in "Design of Prodrugs" by H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985 (the disclosured of which is hereby incorporated by reference), may be placed on appropriate functionalities of the agents. Such prodrugs are also included within the scope of the invention.	[0137] The PcAMP may do any one or more of: directly or indirectly increase the effectiveness of cAMP, directly or indirectly increase the levels of cAMP, directly or indirectly increase the activity of cAMP, directly or indirectly decrease the level of cAMP degradation, directly or indirectly decrease the level of cAMP inhibition.	[0138] Preferably, the agent of the present invention directly or indirectly increases cAMP levels in the sexual genitalia of a female suffering from FSAD.	[0139] More preferably, the agent of the present invention directly or indirectly selectively increases cAMP levels in the sexual genitalia of a female suffering from FSAD.	[0140] More preferably, the agent of the present invention directly or indirectly selectively increases cAMP levels wherein said cAMP is sexually arousal induced cAMP.	[0141] In a highly preferred aspect, the agent of the present invention of the present invention increases the relative amount of sexual arousal induced cAMP.	[0142] For some applications, the agent of the present invention selectively treats FSAD.	[0143] In one aspect, the agent may inhibit or antagonise a suitable target and in doing so potentiate cAMP levels in the female sexual genitalia. In the text, we have used the term inhibitor to mean an inhibitor and/or antagonist.	[0144] In another aspect, the agent may activate or agonise a suitable target and in doing so potentiate cAMP levels in the female sexual genitalia. In the text, we have used the terms activator and upregulator inhibitor to mean activator and/or upregulator and/or agonist.	[0145] Thus, the agent may agonise, antagonise, upregulate, or inhibit a suitable target.	[0146] The agent of the present invention may be a single entity that is capable of exhibiting two or more of these properties. Alternatively, or in addition, the agent of the present invention can be a combination of agents that are capable of exhibiting one or more of these properties.	[0147] Preferably, the agent may selectively agonise, selectively antagonise, selectively upregulate, or selectively inhibit a suitable target.	[0148] Preferably, the agent may selectively agonise, selectively antagonise, selectively upregulate, or selectively inhibit a selective, suitable target.	[0149] The agent may also be capable of displaying one or more other beneficial functional properties. By way of example, the agent of the present invention may potentiate cAMP as well as potentiating cGMP.	[0150] For some applications (such as a topical application), the agent may also display an ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitory action. An ACE assay is presented in the Experimental Section herein. For some applications (such as with particular patient types), such agents (i.e. those that also display ACE inhibitory action) may not be suitable for oral administration.	[0151] For some applications, the agent may also display an ECE (endothelium converting enzyme) inhibitory action. ECE assays are well known in the art.	PHARMACEUTICAL COMBINATIONS	[0152] The agent of the present invention may be used in combination with one or more other pharmaceutically active agents, such as a PcGMP (such a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor eg Sildenafil, or a nitric oxide donor, or a nitric oxide precursor eg L-arginine or inhibitors of arginase) and/or a centrally acting pharmaceutical (e.g. a dopamine receptor agonist such as apomorphine or selective dopamine D2 receptor agonists such as PNU-95666 or a melanocortin receptor agonist, such as melanotan II). Teachings on the use of apomorphine as a pharmaceutical may be found in US-A-5945117. In that particular document, apomorphine is delivered sub-lingually. In addition, or in the alternative, the agent may be used in combination with one or more of: a PDE5 inhibitor (eg sildenafil, vardenafil (Bayer BA 38-9456) and IC351 (Cialis, Icos Lilly)), one or more of a nitric oxide donor (eg NMI-921), one or more of a dopamine receptor agonist (eg apomorphine, Uprima, Ixsene), one or more of a heterocyclic amine such as generically and specifically disclosed in WO 00/40226, in particular example numbers 7, 8 and 9, one or more of a melanocortin receptor agonist (eg Melanotan II or PT14), one or more of a potassium channel opener (eg a KATP channel opener (eg minoxidil, nicorandil) and/or a calcium activated potassium channel opener (eg BMS-204352), one or more of an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist (eg phentolamine, Vasofem, Vasomax), one or more of a VIP receptor agonist or a VIP analogue (eg Ro-125-1553) or a VIP fragment, one or more of a alpha -adrenoceptor antagonist with VIP combination (eg Invicorp, Aviptadil), one or more of a alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist (eg yohimbine), one or more of a estrogen, estrogen and medroxyprogesterone or medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or oestrogen and methyl testosterone hormone replacement therapy agent (eg HRT especially Premarin, Cenestin, Oestrofeminal, Equin, Estrace, Estrofem, Elleste Solo, Estring, Eastraderm, Eastraderm TTS, Eastraderm Matrix, Dermestril, Premphase, Prempro, Prempak, Premique, Estratest, Estratest HS, Tibolone), one or more of a testosterone replacement agent (inc DHEA (dehydroandrostendione), testosterone (Tostrelle) or a testosterone implant (Organon)), one or more of a testosterone/oestradiol agent one or more of an estrogen agonists eg Lasofoxifene, one or more of a serotonin receptor agonist or antagonist (eg 5HT1A, 5HT2C, 5HT2A and 5HT3 receptor agonists and antagonists; as described in WO2000/28993), one or more of a prostanoid receptor agonist (eg Muse, alprostadil, misoprostol), one or more of a purinergic receptor agonist (especially P2Y2 and P2Y4) one or more antidepressant agents (eg bupropion (Wellbutrin), mirrtazapine, nefazodone).	[0153] The structure of IC351 is:	EMI24.1	[0154] If a combination of active agents are administered, then they may be administered simultaneously, separately or sequentially.	VIP COMBINATION	[0155] According to the present invention, the agent is not VIP (or preferably not an analogue thereof or a fragment thereof). However, for some embodiments, the agent of the present invention may be co-administered with VIP or an analogue thereof or a fragment thereof.	[0156] In a highly preferred aspect, VIP or an analogue thereof or a fragment thereof is not administered. This is because there has been a report that VIP infusions lead to significant cardiovascular adverse effects such as increases in heart rate and a decrease in diastolic arterial blood pressure (Ottesen 1983, 1987, 1995)	[0157] In addition, and even though, Ottesen and co-workers have demonstrated that VIP induces increases in vaginal blood flow and lubrication in healthy volunteers, the mechanism by which VIP is exerting it's effects are unclear. In the literature, there are a number of examples of VIP signalling through different second messenger systems eg cGMP/guanylate cyclase (Ashur-Fabian, 1999); carbon monoxide (CO)/heme oxygenase (Fan et al., 1998) and cAMP/adenylate cyclase (Foda,1995; Schoeffter, 1985; Gu, 1992). This is exemplified by a recent report which describes how the vasorelaxant effects of VIP in the uterine artery can be explained by the release of nitric oxide. (Jovanovic, 1998). Again, there is also evidence for VIP modulating nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP in male urogenital function (Kim, 1994).	[0158] Furthermore, in the literature it has been reported that VIP has no effect on cAMP levels in vaginal smooth muscle cell cultures (see Traish, A., Moreland, R.B., Huang, Y., et al. (1999). Development of human and rabbit vaginal smooth muscle cell cultures: Effects of vasoactive agents on intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Comm., 2, 131-137).	[0159] Moreover, in follow up studies, Ottesen and co-workers (see Palle, Bredkjaer, Ottesen and Fahrenkrug 1990 Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology vol 17 61-68), report that the effect of VIP on vaginal blood flow irrespective of the route of administration is part of a systemic vasodilatory effect rather than a local response. In addition, they report on a number of vascular side effects associated with VIP - viz flushing, hypotension and tachycardia.

PHARMACOKINETICS	[0163] For some embodiments of the present invention, preferably the agents of the present invention (and optionally the optional additional agent) have a log D of -2 to +4, more preferably -1 to +2. The log D can be determined by standard procedures known in the art such as described in J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1990, 42:144.	[0164] In addition, or in the alternative, for some embodiments preferably the agents of the present invention (and optionally the optional additional agent) have a caco-2 flux of greater than 2x10<-6>cms<-1>, more preferably greater than 5x10<-6>cms<-1>. The caco flux value can be determined by standard procedures known in the art such as described in J. Pharm. Sci 79, 7, p595-600 (1990), and Pharm. Res. vol 14, no. 6 (1997).	SELECTIVITY	
EP1481667_0005	[0165] For some applications, preferably the agent of the present invention (and optionally the optional additional agent) has at least about a 100 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 150 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 200 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 250 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 300 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 350 fold selectivity to the desired target.	[0166] For some applications, preferably the agent of the present invention (and optionally the optional additional agent) has at least about a 400 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 500 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 600 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 700 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 800 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 900 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 1000 fold selectivity to the desired target.	CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS METHODS	[0167] Typically the agent will be prepared by chemical synthesis techniques.	[0168] The agent or target or variants, homologues, derivatives, fragments or mimetics thereof may be produced using chemical methods to synthesize the agent in whole or in part. For example, peptides can be synthesized by solid phase techniques, cleaved from the resin, and purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography (e.g., Creighton (1983) Proteins Structures And Molecular Principles, WH Freeman and Co, New York NY). The composition of the synthetic peptides may be confirmed by amino acid analysis or sequencing (e.g., the Edman degradation procedure; Creighton, supra).	[0169] Direct synthesis of the agent or variants, homologues, derivatives, fragments or mimetics thereof can be performed using various solid-phase techniques (Roberge JY et al (1995) Science 269: 202-204) and automated synthesis may be achieved, for example, using the ABI 43 1 A Peptide Synthesizer (Perkin Elmer) in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Additionally, the amino acid sequences comprising the agent or any part thereof, may be altered during direct synthesis and/or combined using chemical methods with a sequence from other subunits, or any part thereof, to produce a variant agent or target, such as, for example, a variant NEP.	[0170] In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the coding sequence of the agent target or variants, homologues, derivatives, fragments or mimetics thereof may be synthesized, in whole or in part, using chemical methods well known in the art (see Caruthers MH et al (1980) Nuc Acids Res Symp Ser 215-23, Horn T et al (1980) Nuc Acids Res Symp Ser 225-232).	MIMETIC	[0171] As used herein, the term "mimetic" relates to any chemical which includes, but is not limited to, a peptide, polypeptide, antibody or other organic chemical which has the same qualitative activity or effect as a reference agent to a target.	CHEMICAL DERIVATIVE	[0172] The term "derivative" or "derivatised" as used herein includes chemical modification of an agent. Illustrative of such chemical modifications would be replacement of hydrogen by a halo group, an alkyl group, an acyl group or an amino group.	CHEMICAL MODIFICATION	[0173] In one embodiment of the present invention, the agent may be a chemically modified agent.	[0174] The chemical modification of an agent may either enhance or reduce hydrogen bonding interaction, charge interaction, hydrophobic interaction, Van Der Waals interaction or dipole interaction between the agent and the target.	[0175] In one aspect, the identified agent may act as a model (for example, a template) for the development of other compounds.	RECOMBINANT METHODS	[0176] Typically the target for use in the assay of the present invention may be prepared by recombinant DNA techniques.	POTENTIATING cGMP	[0177] As used herein with reference to cGMP, the term "potentiating" includes any one or more of: increasing the effectiveness of cGMP, increasing the levels of cGMP, increasing the activity of cGMP, decreasing the level of cGMP degradation, decreasing the level of cGMP inhibition.	[0178] The potentiating effect can be a direct effect. Alternatively, it could be a secondary effect and/or a downstream effect.	[0179] Here, preferably, the agent that potentiates cGMP acts on a IcGMP and/or an AMcGMP wherein the modulator of cGMP has an adverse effect on cGMP, such that the agent reduces and/or eliminates and/or masks and/or diverts the detrimental effect of the IcGMP and/or the AMcGMP towards cGMP.	[0180] Hence, the present invention encompasses a combination of one or more I:IcAMP and one or more I:IcGMP. In one aspect, the I:IcGMP is a I:PDEcGMP.	IcAMP AND/OR AMcAMP	[0181] We have shown that cAMP mediates genital (e.g. vaginal or clitoral) blood flow and by enhancing cAMP signalling we can enhance genital (e.g. vaginal or clitoral) blood flow in an animal model. Thus, an agent that upregulates/enhances cAMP-mediated vasorelaxation will be efficacious in the treatment of FSAD. For ease of reference, we refer to these substances as IcAMP and/or an AMcAMP. Here, the IcAMP and the AMcAMP have an adverse effect on cAMP levels or activity.	[0182] Thus, the agent may be any one of more of: an I:IcAMP and/or an I:AMcAMP.	[0183] The agent may be a single entity that is capable of exhibiting two or more of these properties. Alternatively, or in addition, the agent can be a combination of agents that are capable of exhibiting one or more of these properties.	[0184] Examples of IcAMP and the AMcAMP include NEP and one or more of PDE(s) or any component associated therewith. The associated component may be, for example, a receptor and/or a co-factor.	[0185] Thus, the agent of the present invention may be used in conjunction with one of more of: an I:PDEcAMP, an I:NPY (sometimes written as NPYi), an I:NPY Yn (sometimes written as NPY Yni),.	[0186] Likewise, the agent may be a single entity that is capable of exhibiting two or more of these properties. Alternatively, or in addition, the agent can be a combination of agents that are capable of exhibiting one or more of these properties.	I:IcAMP AND/OR I:AMcAMP	[0187] In accordance with the present invention we have found that it is possible to treat and/or prevent FSAD by using an agent that reduces and/or eliminates and/or masks and/or diverts and/or prevents the detrimental effect of the IcAMP and/or the AMcAMP towards cAMP. The agent may even restore cAMP levels that were decreased by the a IcAMP and/or a AMcAMP. For ease, we refer to these substances as I:IcAMP and/or a I:AMcAMP. Here, the I:IcAMP and the I:AMcAMP prevent or reduce the adverse effect on cAMP levels or activity.	[0188] Thus, in one preferred aspect, the agent is an I:IcAMP and/or an I:AMcAMP wherein the AMcAMP has a detrimental effect on AMcAMP.	AcAMP	[0189] In accordance with the present invention, we have found that one of the important causes of FSAD is due to low levels or low activity of cAMP in the female genitalia.	[0190] Thus, the agent may be a U:AcAMP.	[0191] Thus, preferably the agent of the present invention may also be able to act as, and/or may be used in conjunction with, any one of more of: A:AC, A:VIPr, A:VIPn, I:I:VIPr or I:I:VIPn.	[0192] The agent may be a single entity that is capable of exhibiting two or more of these properties. Alternatively, or in addition, the agent can be a combination of agents that are capable of exhibiting one or more of these properties.	U:AcAMP	[0193] In another respect, an additional target may be a component that increases the level of cAMP. Hence, the agent can also act as an U:AC	[0194] Hence, by way of example, the agent of the present invention may also be able to act as, and/or may be used in conjunction with, any one of more of agent can be any one of: an U:AcAMP, an A:AC, an A:VIPr, an A:VIPn, an I:I:VIPr or an I:I:VIPn.	[0195] By way of example, the target could be cAMP itself or AC or VIP (or combinations thereof).	COMBINATION OF I:IcAMP AND/OR I:McAMP AND/OR U:AcAMP	[0196] In another aspect, the agent of the present invention may be used with a combination of cAMP potentiators. By way of example, the agent of the present invention may be used in combination with one or more of:	I:PDEcAMP	I:PDEncAMP	I:NPY	I:NPY Yn	I:NEP	U:AcAMP	A:AC

CAMP mimetic	INHIBITOR	[0197] The term "inhibitor" as used herein with respect to the agent of the present invention means an agent that can reduce and/or eliminate and/or mask and/or prevent the detrimental action of a IcAMP and/or a detrimental McAMP towards cAMP.	ACTIVATOR	[0198] The term "activator" as used herein with respect to the agent of the present invention means an agent that can increase and/or produce and/or unmask and/or elevate and/or ensure action of cAMP and/or an AcAMP. The activator may act as an agonist.	OTHER ACTIVE COMPONENTS	[0199] In another aspect, the agent of the present invention may even be in combination with one or more other active components - such as one or more agents capable of potentiating cGMP.	AMINO ACID SEQUENCE	[0200] As used herein, the term "amino acid sequence" is synonymous with the term "polypeptide" and/or the term "protein". In some instances, the term "amino acid sequence" is synonymous with the term "peptide". In some instances, the term "amino acid sequence" is synonymous with the term "protein".	[0201] The amino acid sequence may be prepared isolated from a suitable source, or it may be made synthetically or it may be prepared by use of recombinant DNA techniques.	[0202] In one aspect, the present invention provides an amino acid sequence that is capable of acting as a target in an assay for the identification of one or more agents and/or derivatives thereof capable of affecting the amino acid sequence in order to potentiate cAMP to treat FSAD.	NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE	[0203] As used herein, the term "nucleotide sequence" is synonymous with the term "polynucleotide".	[0204] The nucleotide sequence may be DNA or RNA of genomic or synthetic or of recombinant origin. The nucleotide sequence may be double-stranded or single-stranded whether representing the sense or antisense strand or combinations thereof.	[0205] For some applications, preferably, the nucleotide sequence is DNA.	[0206] For some applications, preferably, the nucleotide sequence is prepared by use of recombinant DNA techniques (e.g. recombinant DNA).	[0207] For some applications, preferably, the nucleotide sequence is cDNA.	[0208] For some applications, preferably, the nucleotide sequence may be the same as the naturally occurring form for this aspect.	[0209] In one aspect, the present invention provides a nucleotide sequence encoding a substance capable of acting as a target in an assay (such as a yeast two hybrid assay) for the identification of one or more agents and/or derivatives thereof capable of affecting the substance in order to potentiate cAMP to treat FSAD.	[0210] It will be understood by a skilled person that numerous different nucleotide sequences can encode the targets as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code. In addition, it is to be understood that skilled persons may, using routine techniques, make nucleotide substitutions that do not substantially affect the activity encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the present invention to reflect the codon usage of any particular host organism in which the target is to be expressed. Thus, the terms "variant", "homologue" or "derivative" in relation to the nucleotide sequence set out in the attached sequence listings include any substitution of, variation of, modification of, replacement of, deletion of or addition of one (or more) nucleic acid from or to the sequence providing the resultant nucleotide sequence encodes a functional target according the present invention (or even an agent according to the present invention if said agent comprises a nucleotide sequence or an amino acid sequence).	[0211] As indicated above, with respect to sequence homology, preferably there is at least 75%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90% homology to the sequences shown in the sequence listing herein. More preferably there is at least 95%, more preferably at least 98%, homology. Nucleotide homology comparisons may be conducted as described above. A preferred sequence comparison program is the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit program described above. The default scoring matrix has a match value of 10 for each identical nucleotide and -9 for each mismatch. The default gap creation penalty is -50 and the default gap extension penalty is -3 for each nucleotide.	[0212] The present invention also encompasses nucleotide sequences that are capable of hybridising selectively to the sequences presented herein, or any variant, fragment or derivative thereof, or to the complement of any of the above. Nucleotide sequences are preferably at least 15 nucleotides in length, more preferably at least 20, 30, 40 or 50 nucleotides in length. These sequences could be used a probes, such as in a diagnostic kit.	VARIANTS/HOMOLOGUES/DERIVATIVES	[0213] In addition to the specific amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences mentioned herein, the present invention also encompasses the use of variants, homologue and derivatives thereof. Here, the term "homology" can be equated with "identity".	[0214] In the present context, an homologous sequence is taken to include an amino acid sequence which may be at least 75, 85 or 90% identical, preferably at least 95 or 98% identical. In particular, homology should typically be considered with respect to those regions of the sequence known to be essential for an activity. Although homology can also be considered in terms of similarity (i.e. amino acid residues having similar chemical properties/functions), in the context of the present invention it is preferred to express homology in terms of sequence identity.	[0215] Homology comparisons can be conducted by eye, or more usually, with the aid of readily available sequence comparison programs. These commercially available computer programs can calculate % homology between two or more sequences.	[0216] % homology may be calculated over contiguous sequences, i.e. one sequence is aligned with the other sequence and each amino acid in one sequence is directly compared with the corresponding amino acid in the other sequence, one residue at a time. This is called an "ungapped" alignment. Typically, such ungapped alignments are performed only over a relatively short number of residues.	[0217] Although this is a very simple and consistent method, it fails to take into consideration that, for example, in an otherwise identical pair of sequences, one insertion or deletion will cause the following amino acid residues to be put out of alignment, thus potentially resulting in a large reduction in % homology when a global alignment is performed. Consequently, most sequence comparison methods are designed to produce optimal alignments that take into consideration possible insertions and deletions without penalising unduly the overall homology score. This is achieved by inserting "gaps" in the sequence alignment to try to maximise local homology.	[0218] However, these more complex methods assign "gap penalties" to each gap that occurs in the alignment so that, for the same number of identical amino acids, a sequence alignment with as few gaps as possible - reflecting higher relatedness between the two compared sequences - will achieve a higher score than one with many gaps. "Affine gap costs" are typically used that charge a relatively high cost for the existence of a gap and a smaller penalty for each subsequent residue in the gap. This is the most commonly used gap scoring system. High gap penalties will of course produce optimised alignments with fewer gaps. Most alignment programs allow the gap penalties to be modified. However, it is preferred to use the default values when using such software for sequence comparisons. For example when using the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package (see below) the default gap penalty for amino acid sequences is -12 for a gap and -4 for each extension.	[0219] Calculation of maximum % homology therefore firstly requires the production of an optimal alignment, taking into consideration gap penalties. A suitable computer program for carrying out such an alignment is the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package (University of Wisconsin, U.S.A.; Devereux et al., 1984, Nucleic Acids Research 12:387). Examples of other software than can perform sequence comparisons include, but are not limited to, the BLAST package (see Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid - Chapter 18), FASTA (Atschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol., 403-410) and the GENEWORKS suite of comparison tools. Both BLAST and FASTA are available for offline and online searching (see Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid, pages 7-58 to 7-60). However it is preferred to use the GCG Bestfit program. A new tool, called BLAST 2 Sequences is also available for comparing protein and nucleotide sequence (see FEMS Microbiol Lett 1999 174(2): 247-50; FEMS Microbiol Lett 1999 177(1): 187-8 and tatiana@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).	[0220] Although the final % homology can be measured in terms of identity, the alignment process itself is typically not based on an all-or-nothing pair comparison. Instead, a scaled similarity score matrix is generally used that assigns scores to each pairwise comparison based on chemical similarity or evolutionary distance. An example of such a matrix commonly used is the BLOSUM62 matrix - the default matrix for the BLAST suite of programs. GCG Wisconsin programs generally use either the public default values or a custom symbol comparison table if supplied (see user manual for further details). It is preferred to use the public default values for the GCG package, or in the case of other software, the default matrix, such as BLOSUM62.	[0221] Once the software has produced an optimal alignment, it is possible to calculate % homology, preferably % sequence identity. The software typically does this as part of the sequence comparison and generates a numerical result.	[0222] The sequences may also have deletions, insertions or substitutions of amino acid residues which produce a silent change and result in a functionally equivalent substance. Deliberate amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues as long as the secondary binding activity of the substance is retained. For example, negatively charged amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid; positively charged amino acids include lysine and arginine; and amino acids with uncharged polar head groups having similar hydrophilicity values include leucine, isoleucine, valine, glycine, alanine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine.	[0223] Conservative substitutions may be made, for example according to the Table below. Amino acids in the same block in the second column and preferably in the same line in the third column may be substituted for each other:	<TABLE> Columns=3	ALIPHATIC I Non-polar G A P	I L V	Polar - uncharged C S T M	NQ	Polar - charged D E	KR	AROMATIC H F W Y	</TABLE>	[0224] The present invention also encompasses homologous substitution (substitution and replacement are both used herein to mean the interchange of an existing amino acid residue, with an alternative residue) may occur i.e. like-for-like substitution such as basic for basic, acidic for acidic, polar for polar etc. Non-homologous substitution may also occur i.e. from one class of residue to another or alternatively involving the inclusion of unnatural amino acids such as ornithine (hereinafter referred to as Z), diaminobutyric acid ornithine (hereinafter referred to as B), norleucine ornithine (hereinafter referred to as O), pyriylalanine, thienylalanine, naphthylalanine and phenylglycine.	[0225] Replacements may also be made by unnatural amino acids include; alpha* and alpha-disubstituted* amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids*, lactic acid*, halide derivatives of natural amino acids such as trifluorotyrosine*, p-Cl-phenylalanine*, p-Br-phenylalanine*, p-I-phenylalanine*, L-allyl-glycine*, beta -alanine*, L- alpha -amino butyric acid*, L- gamma -amino butyric acid*, L- alpha -amino isobutyric acid*, L- epsilon -amino caproic acid<#>, 7-amino heptanoic acid*, L-methionine sulfone<#>*, L-norleucine*, L-norvaline*, p-nitro-L-phenylalanine*, L-hydroxyproline<#>, L-thioproline*, methyl derivatives of phenylalanine (Phe) such as 4-methyl-Phe*, pentamethyl-Phe*, L-Phe (4-amino)<#>, L-Tyr (methyl)*, L-Phe (4-isopropyl)*, L-Tic (1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxyl acid)*, L-diaminopropionic acid <#> and L-Phe (4-benzyl)*. The notation * has been utilised for the purpose of the discussion above (relating to homologous or non-homologous substitution), to indicate the hydrophobic nature of the derivative whereas # has been utilised to indicate the hydrophilic nature of the derivative, #* indicates amphipathic characteristics.	[0226] Variant amino acid sequences may include suitable spacer groups that may be inserted between any two amino acid residues of the sequence including alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl or propyl groups in addition to amino acid spacers such as glycine or beta -alanine residues. A further form of variation, involves the presence of one or more amino acid residues in peptoid form, will be well understood by those skilled in the art. For the avoidance of doubt, "the peptoid form" is used to refer to variant amino acid residues wherein the alpha -carbon substituent group is on the residue's nitrogen atom rather than the alpha -carbon. Processes for preparing peptides in the peptoid form are known in the art, for example Simon RJ et al., PNAS (1992) 89(20), 9367-9371 and Horwell DC, Trends Biotechnol. (1995) 13(4), 132-134.	
EP1481667_0007	HYBRIDISATION	[0227] The present invention also encompasses the use of sequences that can hybridise to the target sequences presented herein - such as if the agent is an anti-sense sequence.	[0228] The term "hybridization" as used herein shall include "the process by which a strand of nucleic acid joins with a complementary strand through base pairing" as well as the process of amplification as carried out in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technologies.	[0229] Nucleotide sequences of the invention capable of selectively hybridising to the nucleotide sequences presented herein, or to their complement, will be generally at least 75%, preferably at least 85 or 90% and more preferably at least 95% or 98% homologous to the corresponding complementary nucleotide sequences presented herein over a region of at least 20, preferably at least 25 or 30, for instance at least 40, 60 or 100 or more contiguous nucleotides. Preferred nucleotide sequences of the invention will comprise regions homologous to the nucleotide sequence set out in SEQ ID No 2 of the sequence listings of the present invention preferably at least 80 or 90% and more preferably at least 95% homologous to the nucleotide sequence set out in SEQ ID No 2 of the sequence listings of the present invention.	[0230] The term "selectively hybridizable" means that the nucleotide sequence, when used as a probe, is used under conditions where a target nucleotide sequence is found to hybridize to the probe at a level significantly above background. The background hybridization may occur because of other nucleotide sequences present, for example, in the cDNA or genomic DNA library being screened. In this event, background implies a level of signal generated by interaction between the probe and a non-specific DNA member of the library which is less than 10 fold, preferably less than 100 fold as intense as the specific interaction observed with the target DNA. The intensity of interaction may be measured, for example, by radiolabelling the probe, e.g. with <32>P.	[0231] Hybridization conditions are based on the melting temperature (Tm) of the nucleic acid binding complex, as taught in Berger and Kimmel (1987, Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, Methods in Enzymology, Vol 152, Academic Press, San Diego CA), and confer a defined "stringency" as explained below.	[0232] Maximum stringency typically occurs at about Tm-5 DEG C (5 DEG C below the Tm of the probe); high stringency at about 5 DEG C to 10 DEG C below Tm; intermediate stringency at about 10 DEG C to 20 DEG C below Tm; and low stringency at about 20 DEG C to 25 DEG C below Tm. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, a maximum stringency hybridization can be used to identify or detect identical nucleotide sequences while an intermediate (or low) stringency hybridization can be used to identify or detect similar or related polynucleotide sequences.	*[0233] In a preferred aspect, the present invention covers nucleotide sequences that can hybridise to the nucleotide sequence of the present invention under stringent conditions (e.g. 65 DEG C and 0.1xSSC {1xSSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M Na3 Citrate pH 7.0). Where the nucleotide sequence of the invention is double-stranded, both strands of the duplex, either individually or in combination, are encompassed by the present invention. Where the nucleotide sequence is single-stranded, it is to be understood that the complementary sequence of that nucleotide sequence is also included within the scope of the present invention.	[0234] Nucleotide sequences which are not 100% homologous to the sequences of the present invention but fall within the scope of the invention can be obtained in a number of ways. Other variants of the sequences described herein may be obtained for example by probing DNA libraries made from a range of sources. In addition, other viral/bacterial, or cellular homologues particularly cellular homologues found in mammalian cells (e.g. rat, mouse, bovine and primate cells), may be obtained and such homologues and fragments thereof in general will be capable of selectively hybridising to the sequences shown in the sequence listing herein. Such sequences may be obtained by probing cDNA libraries made from or genomic DNA libraries from other animal species, and probing such libraries with probes comprising all or part of the nucleotide sequence set out in herein under conditions of medium to high stringency.	[0235] Similar considerations apply to obtaining species homologues and allelic variants of the amino acid and/or nucleotide sequences of the present invention.	[0236] Variants and strain/species homologues may also be obtained using degenerate PCR which will use primers designed to target sequences within the variants and homologues encoding conserved amino acid sequences within the sequences of the present invention. Conserved sequences can be predicted, for example, by aligning the amino acid sequences from several variants/homologues. Sequence alignments can be performed using computer software known in the art. For example the GCG Wisconsin PileUp program is widely used. The primers used in degenerate PCR will contain one or more degenerate positions and will be used at stringency conditions lower than those used for cloning sequences with single sequence primers against known sequences.	[0237] Alternatively, such nucleotide sequences may be obtained by site directed mutagenesis of characterised sequences, such as the nucleotide sequence set out in SEQ ID No 2 of the sequence listings of the present invention. This may be useful where for example silent codon changes are required to sequences to optimise codon preferences for a particular host cell in which the nucleotide sequences are being expressed. Other sequence changes may be desired in order to introduce restriction enzyme recognition sites, or to alter the activity of the protein encoded by the nucleotide sequences.	[0238] The nucleotide sequences of the present invention may be used to produce a primer, e.g. a PCR primer, a primer for an alternative amplification reaction, a probe e.g. labelled with a revealing label by conventional means using radioactive or nonradioactive labels, or the nucleotide sequences may be cloned into vectors. Such primers, probes and other fragments will be at least 15, preferably at least 20, for example at least 25, 30 or 40 nucleotides in length, and are also encompassed by the term nucleotide sequence of the invention as used herein.	[0239] The nucleotide sequences such as a DNA polynucleotides and probes according to the invention may be produced recombinantly, synthetically, or by any means available to those of skill in the art. They may also be cloned by standard techniques.	[0240] In general, primers will be produced by synthetic means, involving a step wise manufacture of the desired nucleic acid sequence one nucleotide at a time. Techniques for accomplishing this using automated techniques are readily available in the art.	[0241] Longer nucleotide sequences will generally be produced using recombinant means, for example using a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) cloning techniques. This will involve making a pair of primers (e.g. of about 15 to 30 nucleotides) flanking a region of the targeting sequence which it is desired to clone, bringing the primers into contact with mRNA or cDNA obtained from an animal or human cell, performing a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under conditions which bring about amplification of the desired region, isolating the amplified fragment (e.g. by purifying the reaction mixture on an agarose gel) and recovering the amplified DNA. The primers may be designed to contain suitable restriction enzyme recognition sites so that the amplified DNA can be cloned into a suitable cloning vector.	[0242] Due to the inherent degeneracy of the genetic code, other DNA sequences which encode substantially the same or a functionally equivalent amino acid sequence, may be used to clone and express the target sequences. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, for certain expression systems, it may be advantageous to produce the target sequences with non-naturally occurring codons. Codons preferred by a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic host (Murray E et al (1989) Nuc Acids Res 17:477-508) can be selected, for example, to increase the rate of the target expression or to produce recombinant RNA transcripts having desirable properties, such as a longer half-life, than transcripts produced from naturally occurring sequence.	EXPRESSION VECTORS	[0243] The nucleotide sequence for use as the target or for expressing the target can be incorporated into a recombinant replicable vector. The vector may be used to replicate and express the nucleotide sequence in and/or from a compatible host cell. Expression may be controlled using control sequences which include promoters/enhancers and other expression regulation signals. Prokaryotic promoters and promoters functional in eukaryotic cells may be used. Tissue specific or stimuli specific promoters may be used. Chimeric promoters may also be used comprising sequence elements from two or more different promoters described above.	[0244] The protein produced by a host recombinant cell by expression of the nucleotide sequence may be secreted or may be contained intracellularly depending on the sequence and/or the vector used. The coding sequences can be designed with signal sequences which direct secretion of the substance coding sequences through a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membrane.	FUSION PROTEINS	[0245] The target amino acid sequence may be produced as a fusion protein, for example to aid in extraction and purification. Examples of fusion protein partners include glutathione-S-transferase (GST), 6xHis, GAL4 (DNA binding and/or transcriptional activation domains) and beta -galactosidase. It may also be convenient to include a proteolytic cleavage site between the fusion protein partner and the protein sequence of interest to allow removal of fusion protein sequences. Preferably the fusion protein will not hinder the activity of the target.	[0246] The fusion protein may comprise an antigen or an antigenic determinant fused to the substance of the present invention. In this embodiment, the fusion protein may be a non-naturally occurring fusion protein comprising a substance which may act as an adjuvant in the sense of providing a generalised stimulation of the immune system. The antigen or antigenic determinant may be attached to either the amino or carboxy terminus of the substance.	[0247] In another embodiment of the invention, the amino acid sequence may be ligated to a heterologous sequence to encode a fusion protein. For example, for screening of peptide libraries for agents capable of affecting the substance activity, it may be useful to encode a chimeric substance expressing a heterologous epitope that is recognized by a commercially available antibody.	ANTIBODIES	[0248] In one embodiment of the present invention, the agent may be an antibody. In addition, or in the alternative, the target may be an antibody. In addition, or in the alternative, the means for detecting the target may be an antibody.	[0249] Antibodies may be produced by standard techniques, such as by immunisation with the substance of the invention or by using a phage display library.	[0250] For the purposes of this invention, the term "antibody", unless specified to the contrary, includes but is not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, single chain, Fab fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, as well as mimetics thereof. Such fragments include fragments of whole antibodies which retain their binding activity for a target substance, Fv, F(ab') and F(ab')2 fragments, as well as single chain antibodies (scFv), fusion proteins and other synthetic proteins which comprise the antigen-binding site of the antibody. Furthermore, the antibodies and fragments thereof may be humanised antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies, i.e., those which inhibit biological activity of the substance polypeptides, are especially preferred for diagnostics and therapeutics.	[0251] If polyclonal antibodies are desired, a selected mammal (e.g., mouse, rabbit, goat, horse, etc.) is immunised with an immunogenic polypeptide bearing a epitope(s) obtainable from an identified agent and/or substance of the present invention. Depending on the host species, various adjuvants may be used to increase immunological response. Such adjuvants include, but are not limited to, Freund's, mineral gels such as aluminium hydroxide, and surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and dinitrophenol. BCG (Bacilli Calmette-Guerin) and Corynebacterium parvum are potentially useful human adjuvants which may be employed if purified the substance polypeptide is administered to immunologically compromised individuals for the purpose of stimulating systemic defence.	[0252] Serum from the immunised animal is collected and treated according to known procedures. If serum containing polyclonal antibodies to an epitope obtainable from an identifed agent and/or substance of the present invention contains antibodies to other antigens, the polyclonal antibodies can be purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. Techniques for producing and processing polyclonal antisera are known in the art. In order that such antibodies may be made, the invention also provides polypeptides of the invention or fragments thereof haptenised to another polypeptide for use as immunogens in animals or humans.	[0253] Monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes obtainable from an identifed agent and/or substance of the present invention can also be readily produced by one skilled in the art. The general methodology for making monoclonal antibodies by hybridomas is well known. Immortal antibody-producing cell lines can be created by cell fusion, and also by other techniques such as direct transformation of B lymphocytes with oncogenic DNA, or transfection with Epstein-Barr virus. Panels of monoclonal antibodies produced against orbit epitopes can be screened for various properties; i.e., for isotype and epitope affinity.	[0254] Monoclonal antibodies to the substance and/or identified agent may be prepared using any technique which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique originally described by Koehler and Milstein (1975 Nature 256:495-497), the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kosbor et al (1983) Immunol Today 4:72; Cote et al (1983) Proc Natl Acad Sci 80:2026-2030) and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al (1985) Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R Liss Inc, pp 77-96). In addition, techniques developed for the production of "chimeric antibodies", the splicing of mouse antibody genes to human antibody genes to obtain a molecule with appropriate antigen specificity and biological activity can be used (Morrison et al (1984) Proc Natl Acad Sci 81:6851-6855; Neuberger et al (1984) Nature 312:604-608; Takeda et al (1985) Nature 314:452-454). Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (US Patent No. 4,946,779) can be adapted to produce the substance specific single chain antibodies.	[0255] Antibodies, both monoclonal and polyclonal, which are directed against epitopes obtainable from an identifed agent and/or substance are particularly useful in diagnosis, and those which are neutralising are useful in passive immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, in particular, may be used to raise anti-idiotype antibodies. Anti-idiotype antibodies are immunoglobulins which carry an "internal image" of the substance and/or agent against which protection is desired. Techniques for raising anti-idiotype antibodies are known in the art. These anti-idiotype antibodies may also be useful in therapy.	[0256] Antibodies may also be produced by inducing in vivo production in the lymphocyte population or by screening recombinant immunoglobulin libraries or panels of highly specific binding reagents as disclosed in Orlandi et al (1989, Proc Natl Acad Sci 86: 3833-3837), and Winter G and Milstein C (1991; Nature 349:293-299).	[0257] Antibody fragments which contain specific binding sites for the substance may also be generated. For example, such fragments include, but are not limited to, the F(ab')2 fragments which can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the Fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab')2 fragments. Alternatively, Fab expression libraries may be constructed to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity (Huse WD et al (1989) Science 256:1275-128 1).	REPORTERS	[0258] A wide variety of reporters may be used in the assay methods (as well as screens) of the present invention with preferred reporters providing conveniently detectable signals (eg. by spectroscopy). By way of example, a reporter gene may encode an enzyme which catalyses a reaction which alters light absorption properties.	[0259] Examples of reporter molecules include but are not limited to beta -galactosidase, invertase, green fluorescent protein, luciferase, chloramphenicol, acetyltransferase, beta -glucuronidase, exo-glucanase and glucoamylase. Alternatively, radiolabelled or fluorescent tag-labelled nucleotides can be incorporated into nascent transcripts which are then identified when bound to oligonucleotide probes.	[0260] In one preferred embodiment, the production of the reporter molecule is measured by the enzymatic activity of the reporter gene product, such as beta -galactosidase.	[0261] A variety of protocols for detecting and measuring the expression of the target, such as by using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the protein, are known in the art. Examples include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilising monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on polypeptides is preferred, but a competitive binding assay may be employed. These and other assays are described, among other places, in Hampton R et al (1990, Serological Methods, A Laboratory Manual, APS Press, St Paul MN) and Maddox DE et al (1983, J Exp Med 15 8:121 1).	[0262] A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and can be used in various nucleic and amino acid assays. Means for producing labelled hybridisation or PCR probes for detecting the target polynucleotide sequences include oligolabelling, nick translation, end-labelling or PCR amplification using a labelled nucleotide. Alternatively, the coding sequence, or any portion of it, may be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially available, and may be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3 or SP6 and labelled nucleotides.	[0263] A number of companies such as Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ), Promega (Madison, WI), and US Biochemical Corp (Cleveland, OH) supply commercial kits and protocols for these procedures. Suitable reporter molecules or labels include those radionuclides, enzymes, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents as well as substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, magnetic particles and the like. Patents teaching the use of such labels include US-A-3817837; US-A-3850752; US-A-3939350; US-A-3996345; US-A-4277437; US-A-4275149 and US-A-4366241. Also, recombinant immunoglobulins may be produced as shown in US-A-4816567.	[0264] Additional methods to quantify the expression of a particular molecule include radiolabeling (Melby PC et al 1993 J Immunol Methods 159:235-44) or biotinylating (Duplaa C et al 1993 Anal Biochem 229-36) nucleotides, coamplification of a control nucleic acid, and standard curves onto which the experimental results are interpolated. Quantification of multiple samples may be speeded up by running the assay in an ELISA format where the oligomer of interest is presented in various dilutions and a spectrophotometric or calorimetric response gives rapid quantification.	[0265] Although the presence/absence of marker gene expression suggests that the gene of interest is also present, its presence and expression should be confirmed. For example, if the nucleotide sequence is inserted within a marker gene sequence, recombinant cells containing the same may be identified by the absence of marker gene function. Alternatively, a marker gene can be placed in tandem with a target coding sequence under the control of a single promoter. Expression of the marker gene in response to induction or selection usually indicates expression of the target as well.	[0266] Alternatively, host cells which contain the coding sequence for the target and express the target coding regions may be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art. These procedures include, but are not limited to, DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridisation and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques which include membrane-based, solution-based, or chip-based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of the nucleic acid or protein.	GENERAL ASSAYS FOR cAMP ACTIVITY/LEVELS	[0267] The ability of a test agent to potentiate cAMP may be determined by measuring a relevant increase or decrease of a target level. In addition, or in the alternative, the ability of a test agent to potentiate cAMP may be determined by measuring a relevant increase in cAMP levels. By way of example, one may adapt the teachings of Smith et al 1993 (Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 41:189-218). There are also commercially available immunoassay kits for the measurement of cAMP (eg Amersham International, Arlington Heights, IL and DuPont, Boston, MA). Details on a suitable cAMP assay are provided in the Experimental Section.	SCREENS	[0268] Any one or more of appropriate targets - such as an amino acid sequence and/or nucleotide sequence - may be used for identifying a PcAMP in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The target employed in such a test may be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located intracellularly. The target may even be within an animal model, wherein said target may be an exogenous target or an introduced target. The animal model will be a non-human animal model. The abolition of target activity or the formation of binding complexes between the target and the agent being tested may be measured.	[0269] Techniques for drug screening may be based on the method described in Geysen, European Patent Application 84/03564, published on September 13, 1984. In summary, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, such as plastic pins or some other surface. The peptide test compounds are reacted with a suitable target or fragment thereof and washed. Bound entities are then detected - such as by appropriately adapting methods well known in the art. A purified target can also be coated directly onto plates for use in a drug screening techniques. Alternatively, non-neutralising antibodies can be used to capture the peptide and immobilise it on a solid support.	
EP1481667_0008	[0270] This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralising antibodies capable of binding a target specifically compete with a test compound for binding to a target.	[0271] Another technique for screening provides for high throughput screening (HTS) of agents having suitable binding affinity to the substances and is based upon the method described in detail in WO 84/03564.	[0272] It is expected that the assay methods of the present invention will be suitable for both small and large-scale screening of test compounds as well as in quantitative assays.	[0273] Thus, the present invention also relates to a method of identifying agents that potentiate cAMP, the method comprising contacting a suitable target with the agent and then measuring the activity and/or levels of cAMP.	[0274] The present invention also relates to a method of identifying agents that selectively potentiate cAMP in female sexual genitalia, the method comprising contacting a suitable target from female sexual genitalia and then measuring the activity and/or levels of cAMP.	[0275] The present invention also relates to a method of identifying agents that potentiate cAMP, the method comprising contacting a suitable target with the agent and then measuring the activity and/or levels of the target.	[0276] The present invention also relates to a method of identifying agents that selectively potentiate cAMP in female sexual genitalia, the method comprising contacting a suitable target from female sexual genitalia and then measuring the activity and/or levels of the target.	[0277] In a preferred aspect, the screen of the present invention comprises at least the following steps (which need not be in this same consecutive order): (a) conducting an in vitro screen to determine whether a candidate agent has the relevant activity (such as modulation of NEP, such as NEP from dog kidney); (b) conducting one or more selectivity screens to determine the selectivity of said candidate agent (e.g. to see if said agent is also an ACE inhibitor - such as by using the assay protocol presented herein); and (c) conducting an in vivo screen with said candidate agent (e.g. using a functional animal model). Typically, if said candidate agent passes screen (a) and screen (b) then screen (c) is performed.	DIAGNOSTICS	[0278] The present invention also provides a diagnostic composition or kit for the detection of a pre-disposition for FSAD. In this respect, the composition or kit will comprise an entity that is capable of indicating the presence of one or more - or even the absence of one or more - of the targets in a test sample. Preferably, the test sample is obtained from the female sexual genitalia or a secretion thereof or therefrom.	[0279] By way of example, the diagnostic composition may comprise any one of the nucleotide sequences mentioned herein or a variant, homologue, fragment or derivative thereof, or a sequence capable of hybridising to all or part of any one of the nucleotide sequence.	[0280] In order to provide a basis for the diagnosis of disease, normal or standard values from a target should be established. This may be accomplished by combining body fluids or cell extracts taken from normal subjects, either animal or human, with an antibody to a target under conditions suitable for complex formation which are well known in the art. The amount of standard complex formation may be quantified by comparing it to a dilution series of positive controls where a known amount of antibody is combined with known concentrations of a purified target. Then, standard values obtained from normal samples may be compared with values obtained from samples from subjects potentially affected by FSAD. Deviation between standard and subject values establishes the presence of the disease state.	[0281] A target itself, or any part thereof, may provide the basis for a diagnostic and/or a therapeutic compound. For diagnostic purposes, target polynucleotide sequences may be used to detect and quantify gene expression in conditions, disorders or diseases in which FSAD may be implicated.	[0282] The target encoding polynucleotide sequence may be used for the diagnosis of FSAD resulting from expression of the target. For example, polynucleotide sequences encoding a target may be used in hybridisation or PCR assays of tissues from biopsies or autopsies or biological fluids, to detect abnormalities in target expression. The form of such qualitative or quantitative methods may include Southern or northern analysis, dot blot or other membrane-based technologies; PCR technologies; dip stick, pin or chip technologies; and ELISA or other multiple sample formal technologies. All of these techniques are well known in the art and are in fact the basis of many commercially available diagnostic kits.	[0283] Such assays may be tailored to evaluate the efficacy of a particular therapeutic treatment regime and may be used in animal studies, in clinical trials, or in monitoring the treatment of an individual patient. In order to provide a basis for the diagnosis of disease, a normal or standard profile for target expression should be established. This is accomplished by combining body fluids or cell extracts taken from normal subjects, either animal or human, with the target or a portion thereof, under conditions suitable for hybridisation or amplification. Standard hybridisation may be quantified by comparing the values obtained for normal subjects with a dilution series of positive controls run in the same experiment where a known amount of purified target is used. Standard values obtained from normal samples may be compared with values obtained from samples from subjects potentially affected by a disorder or disease related to expression of the target coding sequence. Deviation between standard and subject values establishes the presence of the disease state. If disease is established, an existing therapeutic agent is administered, and treatment profile or values may be generated. Finally, the assay may be repeated on a regular basis to evaluate whether the values progress toward or return to the normal or standard pattern. Successive treatment profiles may be used to show the efficacy of treatment over a period of several days or several months.	[0284] Thus, in one aspect, the present invention relates to the use of a target polypeptide, or variant, homologue, fragment or derivative thereof, to produce anti-target antibodies which can, for example, be used diagnostically to detect and quantify target levels in an FSAD states.	[0285] The present invention further provides diagnostic assays and kits for the detection of a target in cells and tissues comprising a purified target which may be used as a positive control, and anti-target antibodies. Such antibodies may be used in solution-based, membrane-based, or tissue-based technologies to detect any disease state or condition related to the expression of target protein or expression of deletions or a variant, homologue, fragment or derivative thereof.	ASSAY METHODS	[0286] The diagnostic compositions and/or methods and/or kits may be used in the following techniques which include but are not limited to; competitive and non-competitive assays, radioimmunoassay, bioluminescence and chemiluminescence assays, fluorometric assays, sandwich assays, immunoradiometric assays, dot blots, enzyme linked assays including ELISA, microtiter plates, antibody coated strips or dipsticks for rapid monitoring of urine or blood, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry.	[0287] By way of example, an immunohistochemistry kit may also be used for localization of NEP activity in genital tissue. This immunohistochemistry kit permits localization of NEP in tissue sections and cultured cells using both light and electron microscopy which may be used for both research and clinical purposes. Such information may be useful for diagnostic and possibly therapeutic purposes in the detection and/or prevention and/or treatment of a FSD, such as FSAD. For each kit the range, sensitivity, precision, reliability, specificity and reproducibility of the assay are established. Intraassay and interassay variation is established at 20%, 50% and 80% points on the standard curves of displacement or activity.	PROBES	[0288] Another aspect of the subject invention is the provision of nucleic acid hybridisation or PCR probes which are capable of detecting (especially those that are capable of selectively selecting) polynucleotide sequences, including genomic sequences, encoding a target coding region or closely related molecules, such as alleles. The specificity of the probe, i.e., whether it is derived from a highly conserved, conserved or non-conserved region or domain, and the stringency of the hybridisation or amplification (high, intermediate or low) will determine whether the probe identifies only naturally occurring target coding sequence, or related sequences. Probes for the detection of related nucleic acid sequences are selected from conserved or highly conserved nucleotide regions of target family members and such probes may be used in a pool of degenerate probes. For the detection of identical nucleic acid sequences, or where maximum specificity is desired, nucleic acid probes are selected from the non-conserved nucleotide regions or unique regions of the target polynucleotides. As used herein, the term "non-conserved nucleotide region" refers to a nucleotide region that is unique to a target coding sequence disclosed herein and does not occur in related family members.	[0289] PCR as described in US-A-4683195, US-A-4800195 and US-A-4965188 provides additional uses for oligonucleotides based upon target sequences. Such oligomers are generally chemically synthesized, but they may be generated enzymatically or produced from a recombinant source. Oligomers generally comprise two nucleotide sequences, one with sense orientation (5'->3') and one with antisense (3'<-5') employed under optimised conditions for identification of a specific gene or condition. The same two oligomers, nested sets of oligomers, or even a degenerate pool of oligomers may be employed under less stringent conditions for detection and/or quantification of closely related DNA or RNA sequences.	[0290] The nucleic acid sequence for a target can also be used to generate hybridisation probes as previously described, for mapping the endogenous genomic sequence. The sequence may be mapped to a particular chromosome or to a specific region of the chromosome using well known techniques. These include in situ hybridisation to chromosomal spreads (Verma et al (1988) Human Chromosomes: A Manual of Basic Techniques, Pergamon Press, New York City), flow-sorted chromosomal preparations, or artificial chromosome constructions such as YACs, bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), bacterial PI constructions or single chromosome cDNA libraries.	[0291] In situ hybridisation of chromosomal preparations and physical mapping techniques such as linkage analysis using established chromosomal markers are invaluable in extending genetic maps. Examples of genetic maps can be found in Science (1995; 270:410f and 1994; 265:1981f). Often the placement of a gene on the chromosome of another mammalian species may reveal associated markers even if the number or arm of a particular human chromosome is not known. New sequences can be assigned to chromosomal arms, or parts thereof, by physical mapping. This provides valuable information to investigators searching for disease genes using positional cloning or other gene discovery techniques. Once a disease or syndrome has been crudely localised by genetic linkage to a particular genomic region any sequences mapping to that area may represent associated or regulatory genes for further investigation. The nucleotide sequence of the subject invention may also be used to detect differences in the chromosomal location due to translocation, inversion, etc. between normal, carrier or affected individuals.	HOST CELLS	[0292] The term "host cell" - in relation to the present invention includes any cell that could comprise the target for the agent.	[0293] Thus, a further embodiment of the present invention provides host cells transformed or transfected with a polynucleotide that is or expresses the target. Preferably said polynucleotide is carried in a vector for the replication and expression of polynucleotides that are to be the target or are to express the target. The cells will be chosen to be compatible with the said vector and may for example be prokaryotic (for example bacterial), fungal, yeast or plant cells.	[0294] The gram-negative bacterium E. coli is widely used as a host for heterologous gene expression. However, large amounts of heterologous protein tend to accumulate inside the cell. Subsequent purification of the desired protein from the bulk of E.coli intracellular proteins can sometimes be difficult.	[0295] In contrast to E.coli, bacteria from the genus Bacillus are very suitable as heterologous hosts because of their capability to secrete proteins into the culture medium. Other bacteria suitable as hosts are those from the genera Streptomyces and Pseudomonas.	[0296] Depending on the nature of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide of the present invention, and/or the desirability for further processing of the expressed protein, eukaryotic hosts such as yeasts or other fungi may be preferred. In general, yeast cells are preferred over fungal cells because they are easier to manipulate. However, some proteins are either poorly secreted from the yeast cell, or in some cases are not processed properly (e.g. hyperglycosylation in yeast). In these instances, a different fungal host organism should be selected.	[0297] Examples of suitable expression hosts within the scope of the present invention are fungi such as Aspergillus species (such as those described in EP-A-0184438 and EP-A-0284603) and Trichoderma species; bacteria such as Bacillus species (such as those described in EP-A-0134048 and EP-A-0253455), Streptomyces species and Pseudomonas species; and yeasts such as Kluyveromyces species (such as those described in EP-A-0096430 and EP-A-0301670) and Saccharomyces species. By way of example, typical expression hosts may be selected from Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus niger var. tubigenis, Aspergillus niger var. awamori, Aspergillus aculeatis, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus orvzae, Trichoderma reesei, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	[0298] The use of suitable host cells - such as yeast, fungal and plant host cells - may provide for post-translational modifications (e.g. myristoylation, glycosylation, truncation, lapidation and tyrosine, serine or threonine phosphorylation) as may be needed to confer optimal biological activity on recombinant expression products of the present invention.	ORGANISM	[0299] The term "organism" in relation to the present invention includes any organism that could comprise the target and/or products obtained therefrom. Examples of organisms may include a fungus, yeast or a plant.	[0300] The term "transgenic organism" in relation to the present invention includes any organism that comprises the target and/or products obtained.	TRANSFORMATION OF HOST CELLS/HOST ORGANISMS	[0301] As indicated earlier, the host organism can be a prokaryotic or a eukaryotic organism. Examples of suitable prokaryotic hosts include E. coli and Bacillus subtilis. Teachings on the transformation of prokaryotic hosts is well documented in the art, for example see Sambrook et al (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press) and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1995), John Wiley & Sons, Inc.	[0302] If a prokaryotic host is used then the nucleotide sequence may need to be suitably modified before transformation - such as by removal of introns.	[0303] In another embodiment the transgenic organism can be a yeast. In this regard, yeast have also been widely used as a vehicle for heterologous gene expression. The species Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a long history of industrial use, including its use for heterologous gene expression. Expression of heterologous genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been reviewed by Goodey et al (1987, Yeast Biotechnology, D R Berry et al, eds, pp 401-429, Allen and Unwin, London) and by King et al (1989, Molecular and Cell Biology of Yeasts, E F Walton and G T Yarronton, eds, pp 107-133, Blackie, Glasgow).	[0304] For several reasons Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well suited for heterologous gene expression. First, it is non-pathogenic to humans and it is incapable of producing certain endotoxins. Second, it has a long history of safe use following centuries of commercial exploitation for various purposes. This has led to wide public acceptability. Third, the extensive commercial use and research devoted to the organism has resulted in a wealth of knowledge about the genetics and physiology as well as large-scale fermentation characteristics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	[0305] A review of the principles of heterologous gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and secretion of gene products is given by E Hinchcliffe E Kenny (1993, "Yeast as a vehicle for the expression of heterologous genes", Yeasts, Vol 5, Anthony H Rose and J Stuart Harrison, eds, 2nd edition, Academic Press Ltd.).	[0306] Several types of yeast vectors are available, including integrative vectors, which require recombination with the host genome for their maintenance, and autonomously replicating plasmid vectors.	[0307] In order to prepare the transgenic Saccharomyces, expression constructs are prepared by inserting the nucleotide sequence of the present invention into a construct designed for expression in yeast. Several types of constructs used for heterologous expression have been developed. The constructs contain a promoter active in yeast fused to the nucleotide sequence of the present invention, usually a promoter of yeast origin, such as the GAL1 promoter, is used. Usually a signal sequence of yeast origin, such as the sequence encoding the SUC2 signal peptide, is used. A terminator active in yeast ends the expression system.	[0308] For the transformation of yeast several transformation protocols have been developed. For example, a transgenic Saccharomyces according to the present invention can be prepared by following the teachings of Hinnen et al (1978, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA 75, 1929); Beggs, J D (1978, Nature, London, 275, 104); and Ito, H et al (1983, J Bacteriology 153, 163-168).	[0309] The transformed yeast cells are selected using various selective markers. Among the markers used for transformation are a number of auxotrophic markers such as LEU2, HIS4 and TRP1, and dominant antibiotic resistance markers such as aminoglycoside antibiotic markers, eg G418.	[0310] Another host organism is a plant. The basic principle in the construction of genetically modified plants is to insert genetic information in the plant genome so as to obtain a stable maintenance of the inserted genetic material. Several techniques exist for inserting the genetic information, the two main principles being direct introduction of the genetic information and introduction of the genetic information by use of a vector system. A review of the general techniques may be found in articles by Potrykus (Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol [1991] 42:205-225) and Christou (Agro-Food-Industry Hi-Tech March/April 1994 17-27). Further teachings on plant transformation may be found in EP-A-0449375.	[0311] Thus, the present invention also provides a method of transforming a host cell with a nucleotide sequence that is to be the target or is to express the target. Host cells transformed with the nucleotide sequence may be cultured under conditions suitable for the expression and recovery of the encoded protein from cell culture. The protein produced by a recombinant cell may be secreted or may be contained intracellularly depending on the sequence and/or the vector used. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, expression vectors containing coding sequences can be designed with signal sequences which direct secretion of the coding sequences through a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membrane. Other recombinant constructions may join the coding sequence to nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide domain which will facilitate purification of soluble proteins (Kroll DJ et al (1993) DNA Cell Biol 12:441-53).	PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS	[0312] The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the agent of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipients (including combinations thereof).	
EP1481667_0009	[0313] The pharmaceutical compositions may be for human or animal usage in human and veterinary medicine and will typically comprise any one or more of a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, or excipient. Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). The choice of pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as - or in addition to - the carrier, excipient or diluent any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s), solubilising agent(s).	[0314] Preservatives, stabilizers, dyes and even flavoring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be also used.	[0315] There may be different composition/formulation requirements dependent on the different delivery systems. By way of example, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be formulated to be delivered using a mini-pump or by a mucosal route, for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or ingestable solution, or parenterally in which the composition is formulated by an injectable form, for delivery, by, for example, an intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route. Alternatively, the formulation may be designed to be delivered by both routes.	[0316] Where the agent is to be delivered mucosally through the gastrointestinal mucosa, it should be able to remain stable during transit though the gastrointestinal tract; for example, it should be resistant to proteolytic degradation, stable at acid pH and resistant to the detergent effects of bile.	[0317] Where appropriate, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by inhalation, in the form of a suppository or pessary, topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder, by use of a skin patch, orally in the form of tablets containing excipients such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs, solutions or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents, or they can be injected parenterally, for example intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, the compositions may be best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example enough salts or monosaccharides to make the solution isotonic with blood. For buccal or sublingual administration the compositions may be administered in the form of tablets or lozenges which can be formulated in a conventional manner.	[0318] For some embodiments, the agents may also be used in combination with a cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins are known to form inclusion and non-inclusion complexes with drug molecules. Formation of a drug-cyclodextrin complex may modify the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability and/or stability property of a drug molecule. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes are generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, e.g. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser. Alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples are described in WO-A-91/11172, WO-A-94/02518 and WO-A-98/55148.	[0319] In a preferred embodiment, the asents of the present invention are delivered systemically (such as orally, buccally, sublingually), more preferably orally.	[0320] Hence, preferably the agent is in a form that is suitable for oral delivery.	[0321] For some embodiments, preferably the agent - when in use - does not act on the central nervous system.	[0322] For some embodiments, preferably the agent - when in use - is peripherally acting.	ADMINISTRATION	[0323] The term "administered" includes delivery by viral or non-viral techniques. Viral delivery mechanisms include but are not limited to adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectos, herpes viral vectors, retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, and baculoviral vectors. Non-viral delivery mechanisms include lipid mediated transfection, liposomes, immunoliposomes, lipofectin, cationic facial amphiphiles (CFAs) and combinations thereof.	[0324] The agents of the present invention may be administered alone but will generally be administered as a pharmaceutical composition - e.g. when the agent is in admixture with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient, diluent or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.	[0325] For example, the agent can be administered (e.g. orally or topically) in the form of tablets, capsules, ovules, elixirs, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavouring or colouring agents, for immediate-, delayed-, modified-, sustained-, pulsed- or controlled-release applications.	[0326] The tablets may contain excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate and glycine, disintegrants such as starch (preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included.	[0327] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules. Preferred excipients in this regard include lactose, starch, a cellulose, milk sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the agent may be combined with various sweetening or flavouring agents, colouring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof.	[0328] The routes for administration (delivery) include, but are not limited to, one or more of: oral (e.g. as a tablet, capsule, or as an ingestable solution), topical, mucosal (e.g. as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation), nasal, parenteral (e.g. by an injectable form), gastrointestinal, intraspinal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravenous, intrauterine, intraocular, intradermal, intracranial, intratracheal, intravaginal, intracerebroventricular, intracerebral, subcutaneous, ophthalmic (including intravitreal or intracameral), transdermal, rectal, buccal, vaginal, epidural, sublingual.	[0329] It is to be understood that not all of the agent need be administered by the same route. Likewise, if the composition comprises more than one active component, then those components may be administered by different routes.	[0330] If the agent of the present invention is administered parenterally, then examples of such administration include one or more of: intravenously, intra-arterially, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intraventricularly, intraurethrally, intrasternally, intracranially, intramuscularly or subcutaneously administering the agent; and/or by using infusion techniques.	[0331] For parenteral administration, the agent is best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary. The preparation of suitable parenteral formulations under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well-known to those skilled in the art.	[0332] As indicated, the agent of the present invention can be administered intranasally or by inhalation and is conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder inhaler or an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurised container, pump, spray or nebuliser with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134A TM ) or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227EA TM ), carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurised aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurised container, pump, spray or nebuliser may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound, e.g. using a mixture of ethanol and the propellant as the solvent, which may additionally contain a lubricant, e.g. sorbitan trioleate. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the agent and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.	[0333] Alternatively, the agent can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or it may be applied topically in the form of a gel, hydrogel, lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. The agent may also be dermally or transdermally administered, for example, by the use of a skin patch. They may also be administered by the pulmonary or rectal routes. They may also be administered by the ocular route. For ophthalmic use, the compounds can be formulated as micronised suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, optionally in combination with a preservative such as a benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, they may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.	[0334] For application topically to the skin, the agent can be formulated as a suitable ointment containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture with one or more of the following: mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, it can be formulated as a suitable lotion or cream, suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture of one or more of the following: mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, a polyethylene glycol, liquid paraffin, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.	[0335] The compositions of the present invention may be administered by direct injection.	[0336] For some applications, preferably the agent is administered orally.	[0337] For some applications, preferably the agent is administered topically.	DOSE LEVELS	[0338] Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual subject. The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy. The agent and/or the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be administered in accordance with a regimen of from 1 to 10 times per day, such as once or twice per day.	[0339] For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the agent may be in single or divided doses.	[0340] Depending upon the need, the agent may be administered at a dose of from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg body weight, such as from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, more preferably from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg body weight. Naturally, the dosages mentioned herein are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited.	FORMULATION	[0341] The agent may be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition, such as by mixing with one or more of a suitable carrier, diluent or excipient, by using techniques that are known in the art.	[0342] The following present some non-limiting examples of formulations.	[0343] Formulation 1: A tablet is prepared using the following ingredients:	<TABLE> Columns=2	Head Col 1:	Head Col 2: weight/mg	Agent 250	Cellulose, microcrystalline 400	Silicon dioxide, fumed 10	Stearic acid 5	Total 665	</TABLE> the components are blended and compressed to form tablets each weighing 665mg.	[0344] Formulation 2: An intravenous formulation may be prepared as follows:	<TABLE> Columns=2	Agent 100mg	Isotonic saline 1,000ml	</TABLE>	PHARMACEUTICALLY ACTIVE SALT	[0345] The agent may be administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Typically, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be readily prepared by using a desired acid or base, as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent.	
EP1481667_0010	ANIMAL TEST MODELS	[0346] In vivo models may be used to investigate and/or design therapies or therapeutic agents to treat FSAD. The models could be used to investigate the effect of various tools/lead compounds on a variety of parameters which indicate the sexual arousal response. These animal test models can be used as, or in, the assay of the present invention. The animal test model will be a non-human animal test model.	[0347] There are a number of animal models for vasculogenic female sexual dysfunction (FSAD) available that could be used.	[0348] By way of example, reference may be made to invasive animal models (e.g. see Park et al., 1997). Here, vaginal and clitoral haemodynamic responses can be directly recorded following pelvic nerve stimulation in normal and atherosclerotic female rabbits. The in vivo effects of cAMP potentiators can be investigated either in normal or FSAD animals.	[0349] By way of further example, reference may be made to non-invasive animal models (e.g. see the review of Goldstein et al., 1998; Laan et al., 1998). Here, pulsed wave Doppler ultrasonography provides a means of detecting blood flow changes in the vaginal and clitoral arteries. This model can be used to investigate vasculogenic effects during pharmacological administration of vasodilators.	[0350] Other non-invasive techniques that can be used include vaginal photoplethysmography, which provides a quantitative measure of vaginal mucosa engorgement, and vaginal thermal clearance techniques, which are based on the principle that vaginal blood flow changes can be recorded by measuring the heat transfer away from an intravaginal probe kept at a constant temperature.	AN ANIMAL MODEL OF SEXUAL AROUSAL	[0351] In our studies we have developed a robust reproducible model of the physiology of sexual arousal. This model uses an anaesthetised rabbit and employs Laser Doppler technologies to monitor genital blood flow whilst routinely recording cardiovascular parameters. We are capable of measuring small changes in vaginal (and even clitoral) blood flow induced by pelvic nerve stimulation or infusion of VIP in the absence and presence of test agents.	[0352] We believe that our animal model directly reflects the clinical data. Hence, this model can be used to study candidate agents for the treatment of FSAD, such as measuring enhancement of vaginal or clitoral blood flow.	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT OF FEMALE SEXUAL AROUSAL	[0353] In accordance with the present invention, a number of different techniques may be used for measuring clitoral and vaginal blood flow. By way of example, use may be made of vaginal photoplethysmography, vaginal heat washout technique, clitoral and vaginal contrast-enhanced MRI, clitoral/vulval laser Doppler pulsed imaging, and clitoral ultrasonography.	[0354] Quantification of vaginal lubrication may also be measured by techniques known in the art - such as (a) pre- and post-stimulation weighing of vaginal tampons, and (b) measuring the pH of vaginal fluid. With respect to the latter aspect, the normal resting acid medium in the vagina becomes more alkaline as it approaches blood pH when transudation of fluid occurs during sexual stimulation.	NEP (neutral endopeptidase)	[0355] According to the present invention, the target is a PcAMP target, which PcAMP target is NEP.	[0356] Nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences for NEP is available in the literature. Some sequences are presented in the Sequence Listings provided herein.	[0357] In one aspect, the NEP is NEP (EC 3.4.24.11) (also known as enkephalinase or endopeptidase-2). Here, we have found NEP EC 3.4.24.11 mRNA and expressed protein in human and rabbit vagina.	[0358] Here, we believe that in females including those suffering from FSAD, VIP is degraded by NEP EC3.4.24.11. Thus, NEP inhibitors will potentiate the endogenous vasorelaxant effect of VIP released during arousal. This will lead to a treatment of FSAD, such as through enhanced vaginal engorgement. We have shown that selective inhibitors of NEP EC 3.4.24.11 enhance pelvic nerve-stimulated and VIP-induced increases in genital (e.g. vaginal or clitoral) blood flow. In addition that selective NEP inhibitors enhance VIP and nerve-mediated relaxations of isolated vagina wall.	[0359] Background teachings on NEP have been presented by Victor A. McKusick et al on http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/searchomim.htm. The following information concerning NEP has been extracted from that source.	"Common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen is an important cell surface marker in the diagnosis of human acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). It is present on leukemic cells of pre-B phenotype, which represent 85% of cases of ALL. CALLA is not restricted to leukemic cells, however, and is found on a variety of normal tissues. CALLA is a glycoprotein that is particularly abundant in kidney, where it is present on the brush border of proximal tubules and on glomerular epithelium. Letarte et al. (1988) cloned a cDNA coding for CALLA and showed that the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence is identical to that of human membrane-associated neutral endopeptidase (NEP; EC 3.4.24.11 ), also known as enkephalinase. NEP cleaves peptides at the amino side of hydrophobic residues and inactivates several peptide hormones including glucagon, enkephalins, substance P, neurotensin, oxytocin, and bradykinin. By cDNA transfection analysis, Shipp et al. (1989) confirmed that CALLA is a functional neutral endopeptidase of the type that has previously been called enkephalinase. Barker et al. (1989) demonstrated that the CALLA gene, which encodes a 100-kD type II transmembrane glycoprotein, exists in a single copy of greater than 45 kb which is not rearranged in malignancies expressing cell surface CALLA. The gene was located to human chromosome 3 by study of somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization regionalized the location to 3q21-q27. Tran-Paterson et al. (1989) also assigned the gene to chromosome 3 by Southern blot analysis of DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. D'Adamio et al. (1989) demonstrated that the CALLA gene spans more than 80 kb and is composed of 24 exons."	I:NEP	[0360] As indicated above, the agent may be any suitable agent that can act as an I:NEP.

J. 142, 575-581.	3.3 Frozen kidneys are allowed to thaw at room temperature and the cortex is dissected away from the medulla.	3.4 The cortex is finely chopped and homogenised in approximately 10 volumes of homogenisation buffer (1.2) using a Braun miniprimer (2.2).	3.5 Magnesium chloride (1.8) (20.3mg/gm tissue) is added to the homogenate and stirred in an ice-water bath for 15 minutes.	3.6 The homogenate is centrifuged at 1,500g (3,820rpm) for 12 minutes in a Beckman centrifuge (2.3) before removing the supernatant to a fresh centrifuge tube and discarding the pellet.	3.7 The supernatant is centrifuged at 15,000g (12,100rpm) for 12 minutes in a Sovall centrifuge (2.1) and the supernatant is discarded.	3.8 The pale pink layer on the top of the remaining pellet is removed and re-suspended in homogenisation buffer containing magnesium chloride (9mg MgCl in 5ml buffer per 1g tissue).	3.9 The suspension is centrifuged at 2,200g (4,630rpm) for 12 minutes in a Beckman centrifuge (2.3) before discarding the pellet.	3.10 The supernatant is centrifuged at 15,000g (12,100rpm) for 12 minutes using the Sorvall centrifuge (2.1) and the supernatant is discarded.	3.11 The final pellet is resuspended in homogenisation buffer containing magnesium chloride (0.9mg MgCl in 0.5ml buffer per 1g tissue). A homogenous suspension is obtained using a Braun miniprimer (2.2). This is then frozen down in 100 mu l aliquots to be assayed for NEP activity.	4.0 DETERMINATION OF NEP ACTIVITY	[0373] The activity of the previously aliquoted NEP is measured by its ability to cleave the NEP specific peptide substrate.	4.1 A 4% DMSO/NEP buffer solution is made (4mls DMSO in 96mls NEP buffer).	4.2 Substrate, total product, enzyme, and Phosphoramidon stocks are left on ice to thaw.	4.3 50 mu l of 4% DMSO/NEP buffer solution is added to each well.	4.4 The 2mM substrate stock is diluted 1:40 to make a 50 mu M solution. 100 mu l of 50 mu M substrate is added to each well (final concentration 25 mu M).	4.5 50 mu l of a range of enzyme dilutions is added to initiate the reaction (usually 1:100, 1:200, 1:400, 1:800, 1:1600, and 1:3200 are used). 50 mu l of NEP buffer is added to blank wells.	4.6 The 2mM total product is diluted 1:80 to make a 25 mu M solution. 200 mu l of 25 mu M product is added to the first four wells of a new plate.	4.7 Plates are incubated at 37 DEG C in a shaking incubator for 60 minutes.	4.8 The 300 mu M Phosphoramidon stock is diluted 1:100 to 300nM. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 100 mu l 300nM Phosphoramidon and incubated at 37 DEG C in a shaking incubator for 20 minutes before being read on the Fluostar (ex320/em420).	5.

All further dilutions are carried out in a 4% DMSO solution (4mls DMSO in 96mls NEP buffer).	5.3 50 mu l of compound in duplicate is added to the 96 well plate and 50 mu l of 4% DMSO/NEP buffer is added to control and blank wells.	5.4 The 2mM substrate stock is diluted 1:40 in NEP buffer to make a 50 mu M solution (275 mu l 2mM substrate to 10.73ml buffer is enough for 1 plate).	5.5 The enzyme stock diluted in NEP buffer (determined from activity checks).	5.6 The 2mM total product stock is diluted 1:80 in NEP buffer to make a 25 mu M solution. 200 mu l is added to the first four wells of a separate plate.	5.7 The 300 mu M Phosphoramidon stock is diluted 1:1000 to make a 300nM stock (11 mu l Phosphoramidon to 10.99ml NEP buffer.	5.8 To each well in the 96 well plate the following is added:	Table Reagents to be added to 96 well plate.	<TABLE> Columns=6	Head Col 1:	Head Col 2: Compound/ DMSO	Head Col 3: Tris Buffer	Head Col 4: Substrate	Head Col 5: NEP enzyme	Head Col 6: Total product	Samples 2 mu l compound 50 mu l 100 mu l 50 mu l None	Controls 2 mu l DMSO 50 mu l 100 mu l 50 mu l None	Blanks 2 mu l DMSO 100 mu l 100 mu l None None	Totals 2 mu l DMSO None None None 200 mu l	</TABLE>	5.9 The reaction is initiated by the addition of the NEP enzyme before incubating at 37 DEG C for 1 hour in a shaking incubator.	5.10 The reaction is stopped with 100 mu l 300nM Phosphoramidon and incubated at 37 DEG C for 20 minutes in a shaking incubator before being read on the Fluostar (ex320/em420).	6.

PDE (phosphodiesterase)	[0377] According to one aspect of the present invention, an additional target may be another PcAMP target, such as PDE (phosphodiesterase), in particular a PDE which is a cAMP hydrolysing PDE (and optionally cGMP hydrolysing).	[0378] It is known that cyclic nucleotides, such as cAMP and cGMP, are important intracellular second messengers. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases - otherwise known as PDEs - are a family of enzymes that catalyse the degradation of cyclic nucleotides and, in doing so, are one of the cellular components that regulate the concentration of cyclic nucleotides.	[0379] In recent years, at least seven PDE enzymes (such as PDEI - PDEVII), as well as many subtypes of these enzymes, have been defined based on substrate affinity and cofactor requirements (Beavo JA and Reifsnyder DH, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 11:150 [1990]; Beavo J, In: Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases: Structure, Regulation and Drug Action., Beavo J and Housley MD (Eds.). Wiley:Chichester, pp. 3-15 [1990]).	[0380] Examples of PDEs include: PDEI which is a Ca<2+>/Calmodulin-dependent PDE; PDEII which is a cAMP and cGMP stimulated PDE; PDEIII which is a cGMP inhibited PDE; PDEIV which is a high affinity cAMP-specific PDE; and PDEV which is a cGMP specific PDE. PDEI etc. are sometimes called PDE type I etc. or PDE type 1 etc.	[0381] Each PDE family may contain two or more isoforms (i.e. there may be two or more PDE isoenzymes). By way of example, mammalian PDE IV, the homologue of the Drosophila Dunce gene (Chen CN et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA) 83:9313 [1986]), is known to have four isoforms in the rat (Swinnen JV et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA) 86:5325 [1989]). Human PDEs are also known to occur as isoforms and have splice variants. For example, the cloning of one human isoform of PDEIV from monocytes was reported in 1990 (Livi GP et al., Mol. Cell. Bio., 10:2678 [1990]). By way of further example, other workers have independently cloned three splice variants of PDEIV, which are now designated hPDEIV-B1, hPDEIV-B2, and hPDEIV-B3.	[0382] Teachings on cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases can also be found in US-A-5932423 and US-A-5932465.	[0383] Teachings on a further cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase - namely CN PCDE8 - can be found in WO-A-97/35989. According to WO-A-97/35989, CN PCDE8 has two isozymes - which were designated CN PCDE8A and CN PCDE8B. The term "isozyme" is sometimes referred to in the art as "isoform".	[0384] According to WO-A-97/35989, many inhibitors of different PDEs have been identified and some have undergone clinical evaluation. For example, PDEIII inhibitors are being developed as antithrombotic agents, as antihypertensive agents and as cardiotonic agents useful in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Rolipram, a PDEIII inhibitor, has been used in the treatment of depression and other inhibitors of PDEIII are undergoing evaluation as anti-inflammatory agents. Rolipram has also been shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced TNF-alpha which has been shown to enhance HIV-1 replication in vitro. Therefore, rolipram may inhibit HIV-1 replication (Angel et al 1995 AIDS 9:1137-44). Additionally, based on its ability to suppress the production of TNF alpha and beta and interferon gamma, rolipram has been shown to be effective in the treatment of encephalomyelitis, the experimental animal model for multiple sclerosis (Sommer et al, 1995 Nat Med 1:244-248) and may be effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (Sasaki et al, 1995 Eur J Phamacol 282:71-76).	[0385] According to WO-A-97/35989, there are also non-specific PDE inhibitors such as theophylline, used in the treatment of bronchial asthma and other respiratory diseases, and pentoxifylline, used in the treatment of intermittent claudication and diabetes-induced peripheral vascular disease. Theophylline is thought to act on airway smooth muscle function as well as in an anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory capacity in the treatment of respiratory diseases (Banner et al 1995 Respir J 8:996-1000) where it is thought to act by inhibiting both CN PDE cAMP and cGMP hydrolysis (Banner et al 1995 Monaldi Arch Chest Dis 50:286-292). Pentoxifylline, also known to block TNF-alpha production, may inhibit HIV-1 replication (Angel et al supra). A list of CN PDE inhibitors is given in Beavo 1995 supra.	[0386] It has been suggested that selective inhibitors of PDEs, in addition to their isozymes and their subtypes, will lead to more effective therapy with fewer side effects. For example, see the teachings in the reviews of Wieshaar RE et al, (J. Med. Chem., 28:537 [1985]), Giembycz MA (Biochem. Pharm., 43:2041 [1992]) and Lowe JA and Cheng JB (Drugs of the Future, 17:799-807 [1992]).	[0387] Thus, for some applications it is desirable to have a selective inhibition of an individual type of PDE.	[0388] Background teachings on PDEs have been presented by Victor A. McKusick et al on http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/searchomim.htm. The following information concerning PDE2 or cGMP-stimulated PDE, has been extracted from that source.	"Cyclic nucleotides serve as second messengers that mediate a variety of cellular responses to extracellular signals such as hormones, light, and neurotransmitters. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) play a role in signal transduction by regulating the cellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides. Mammalian cells contain multiple PDEs that are distinguished into at least 7 families based on their substrate affinity and on their selective sensitivity to cofactors and inhibitory drugs. These families are: (I) Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent PDEs; (II) cGMP-stimulated PDEs; (III) cGMP-inhibited PDEs; (IV) cAMP-specific PDEs; (V) cGMP-specific PDEs; (VI) photoreceptor PDEs; and (VII) high-affinity, cAMP-specific. From the amino acid sequences, it is evident that all these PDE families contain a related domain, thought to be the catalytic domain, with approximately 30% sequence identity between families. Members of the same family are more closely related; they share 60 to 80% sequence identity throughout the entire coding region.	Michaeli et al. (1993) established a highly sensitive functional screen for the isolation of cDNAs encoding cAMP phosphodiesterases by complementation of defects in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking both endogenous cAMP PDE genes, PDE1 and PDE2. Three groups of cDNAs corresponding to 3 distinct human genes encoding cAMP-specific PDEs were isolated from a human glioblastoma cDNA library using this functional screen. Two of the genes were closely related to the Drosophila 'dunce' cAMP-specific PDE. The third gene, which Michaeli et al. (1993) referred to as HCP1, encoded a novel cAMP-specific PDE. HCP1 had an amino acid sequence related to the sequences of the catalytic domains of all cyclic nucleotide PDEs. It is a high-affinity cAMP-specific PDE that does not share other properties of the cAMP-specific PDE family, however. The PDE activity of HCP1 was not sensitive to cGMP or other inhibitors of the cGMP-inhibitable PDEs. The biochemical and pharmacologic properties of HCP1 suggested to Michaeli et al. (1993) that it is a member of a previously undiscovered cyclic nucleotide PDE family, which they designated as family VII. Northern blot analysis indicated the presence of high levels of an HCP1 RNA in human skeletal muscle.	By Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines, Milatovich et al. (1994) mapped the HCP1 locus to chromosome 8; by study of somatic cell hybrid lines that contained different regions of chromosome 8, they regionalized the assignment to 8q13-q22. Han et al. (1998) mapped the PDE7A gene to 8q13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. By interspecific backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse Pde7A gene to the proximal region of chromosome 3."	[0389] Background teachings on PDE2 have been presented by Jennifer P. Macke et al on http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/searchomim.htm. The following information concerning PDE2 cGMP-stimulated has been extracted from that source.	"Rosman et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA corresponding to human PDE2A. The PDE2A gene encodes a 941 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 106 kD. The protein sequence is 90% identical to bovine and rat PDE2A sequences. Northern blot analysis showed that PDE2A was expressed as a 4.2-kb mRNA at varying levels in all human tissues tested, with greatest expression in brain. Expression studies revealed that PDE2A hydrolyzes cAMP and cGMP and is inhibited by the PDE2A-specific inhibitor EHNA."

[0398] Preferred I:PDEs are selected from the following structures:	EMI87.1	NPY (neuropeptide Y)	[0399] According to one aspect of the present invention, the additional target is a PcAMP target, which PcAMP target is NPY or one of its associated receptors.	[0400] Nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences for NPY and its receptors are available in the literature. Some sequences are presented in the Sequence Listings provided herein.	[0401] Here, we have found that neuropeptide Y (NPY) exerts an inhibitory regulatory influence over vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-mediated vasorelaxation. Thus, inhibition of NPY receptors will result in an increased pelvic nerve and VIP-mediated increases in genital (e.g. vaginal or clitoral) blood flow. Clinically this will lead to increased vaginal and/or clitoral engorgement which will ultimately lead to increased lubrication via plasma transudation and increased vaginal compliance. Hence, a suitable target for the treatment of FSAD is NPY or one of its associated receptors.	
EP1481667_0015	[0402] Thus, in one preferred aspect, the additional agent is an NPY Y1 Y2 or Y5 antagonist, preferably an oral NPY Y1 Y2 or Y5 antagonist. This agent will treat FSAD by increasing genital (e.g. vaginal or clitoral) blood flow and increasing lubrication.	[0403] The NPY-mediated antagonism of VIP-induced increases in blood flow therefore represents a potential therapeutic target by which blood flow in the female genital tract can be influenced. The mechanism through which this antagonism occurs is most likely through NPY Y1 receptor-induced Gi/o activation. In other physiological systems NPY Y1 receptors have been implicated in mediating vasoconstriction and inhibiting sympathetic transmitter release (Lundberg et al., 1996; a NPY Y2 effect can not be excluded). We believe in the female genital tract that NPY inhibits vasorelaxation via direct inhibition of adenylate cyclase direct inhibiting VIP release or sympathetic neurotransmission.	[0404] As indicated, an additional PcAMP target is one of the NPY receptors.	[0405] The neuronal release of NPY regulates the VIP-induced vasorelaxation of the vaginal vascular bed. This most likely occurs via a presynaptic mechanism involving NPY Y1 receptors, although a post-synaptic mode of action can not be excluded. An NPY antagonist will potentiate VIP-induced vasodilation of the vaginal vascular beds. Clinically this will lead to increased vaginal lubrication and compliance via vaginal wall engorgement.	[0406] NPY receptor expression studies performed by us have identified NPY Y1 Y2 and Y5 receptor subtypes within the human vagina.	[0407] Hence, in one aspect, the additional PcAMP target is one or more of the NPY Y1 Y2 and Y5 receptor subtypes.	[0408] Background teachings on NPY and it associated receptors have been prepared by Victor A. McKusick et al on http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/searchomim.htm. The following text concerning NPY has been extracted from that source.	"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an abundant and widespread peptide in the mammalian nervous system. It shows sequence homology to peptide YY and over 50% homology in amino acid and nucleotide sequence to pancreatic polypeptide (PNP; 167780). NPY is a 36-amino acid peptide. Minth et al. (1984) cloned the NPY gene starting from mRNA of a pheochromocytoma. Takeuchi et al. (1985, 1986) isolated cDNA clones of the NPY and PNP genes from a pheochromocytoma and a pancreatic endocrine tumor, respectively. Using these cDNA probes to analyze genomic DNA from chromosome assignment panels of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, they then examined the question of whether the genes are syntenic. The studies showed nonsynteny, with NPY on 7pter-7q22 and PNP on 17p11.1-17qter. By studies of a backcross with Mus spretus, Bahary et al. (1991) mapped the homologous NPY gene to mouse chromosome 6. Since mouse chromosome 6 has homology to human 7q, it is likely that the NPY gene in man is located in the region 7cen-q22. Meisler et al. (1987) excluded close linkage between the loci for cystic fibrosis (219700) and neuropeptide Y. Terenghi et al. (1987) determined the distribution of mRNA encoding NPY in neurons of the cerebral cortex in surgical biopsy specimens and postmortem brain by means of in situ hybridization techniques. They showed consistent localization of NPY gene transcription and expression in normal mature cortical neurons. Baker et al. (1995) showed by fluorescence in situ hybridization that the NPY gene is located on 7p15.1 and exists in single copy. They commented that NPY is one of the most highly conserved peptides known, with, for example, only 3 amino acid differences between human and shark. Neuropeptide Y is a neuromodulator implicated in the control of energy balance and is overproduced in the hypothalamus of ob/ob mice. To determine the role of NPY in the response to leptin (164160) deficiency, Erickson et al. (1996) generated ob/ob mice deficient in NPY. In the absence of NPY, ob/ob mice were less obese because of reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure, and were less severely affected by diabetes, sterility, and somatotropic defects. These results were interpreted as indicating that NPY is a central effector of leptin deficiency. Genetic linkage analysis of rats that were selectively bred for alcohol preference identified a chromosomal region that included the NPY gene (Carr et al., 1998). Alcohol-preferring rats had lower levels of NPY in several brain regions compared with alcohol-nonpreferring rats. Thiele et al. (1998) therefore studied alcohol consumption by mice that completely lacked NPY as a result of targeted gene disruption (Erickson et al., 1996). They found that NPY-deficient mice showed increased consumption, compared with wildtype mice, of solutions containing 6%, 10%, and 20% (by volume) ethanol. NPY-deficient mice were also less sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of ethanol, as shown by more rapid recovery from ethanol-induced sleep, even though plasma ethanol concentrations did not differ significantly from those of controls. In contrast, transgenic mice that overexpressed a labeled NPY gene in neurons that usually express it had a lower preference for ethanol and were more sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of ethanol than controls. These data provided direct evidence that alcohol consumption and resistance are inversely related to NPY levels in the brain. As part of an on-going study of the genetic basis of obesity, Karvonen et al. (1998) identified a 1128T-C polymorphism that resulted in substitution of leucine by proline at residue 7 in the signal peptide part of pre-pro-NPY. This polymorphism was not associated with obesity or energy metabolism, but was significantly and consistently associated with high serum total and LDL cholesterol levels both in normal-weight and obese Finns and in obese Dutch subjects. Uusitupa et al. (1998) found the pro7 polymorphism in 14% of Finns but in only 6% of Dutchmen. Subjects with pro7 in NPY had, on average, 0.6 to 1.4 mmol/L higher serum total cholesterol levels than those without this gene variant. As the impact of pro7 NPY on serum cholesterol levels could not be found in normal-weight Dutchmen, it can be assumed that obese persons may be more susceptible to the effect of the gene variant. It was calculated that the probability of having the pro7 in NPY could be as high as 50 to 60% in obese subjects with a total serum cholesterol equal to or higher than 8 mmol/L. At least among Finns, the pro7 form of NPY is one of the strongest genetic factors affecting serum cholesterol levels.

[0409] As indicated background teachings on NPY and it associated receptors have been prepared by Victor A. McKusick et al (ibid). The following text concerning NPYR1 has been extracted from that source.	"Neuropeptide Y (NPY; 162640) is one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the mammalian nervous system and exhibits a diverse range of important physiologic activities, including effects on psychomotor activity, food intake, regulation of central endocrine secretion, and potent vasoactive effects on the cardiovascular system. Two major subtypes of NPY (Y1 and Y2) have been defined by pharmacologic criteria. The NPY Y1 receptors have been identified in a variety of tissues, including brain, spleen, small intestine, kidney, testis, placenta, and aortic smooth muscle. The Y2 receptor is found mainly in the central nervous system. Herzog et al. (1992) reported cloning of a cDNA encoding a human NPY receptor which they confirmed to be a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or human embryonic kidney cells, the receptor exhibited characteristic ligand specificity. In the kidney cell line, the receptor was coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein that mediated the inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation. In the CHO cell line, on the other hand, the receptor was coupled not to inhibition of adenylate cyclase but rather to the elevation of intracellular calcium. Thus the second messenger coupling of the NPY receptor was cell type specific, depending on the specific repertoire of G proteins and effector systems present in the cell type. Larhammar et al. (1992) independently cloned and characterized the neuropeptide Y receptor. Herzog et al. (1993) determined the molecular organization and regulation of the human NPY Y1 receptor gene. In contrast to the contiguous structure of most G protein-coupled receptor genes, they found that the NPY Y1 receptor gene has 3 exons. They also identified a common Pstl polymorphism in the first intron of the gene. By high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization, they localized the gene to 4q31.3-q32. Herzog et al. (1997) found that the NPY1R and NPY5R (602001) genes are colocalized on chromosome 4q31-q32. The 2 genes are transcribed in opposite directions from a common promoter region. One of the alternately spliced 5-prime exons of the Y1 receptor gene is a part of the coding sequence of the Y5 receptor. This unusual arrangement suggested to Herzog et al. (1997) that the 2 genes arose by a gene duplication event and that they may be coordinately expressed. By interspecific backcross analysis, Lutz et al. (1997) mapped the Npy1r and Npy2r genes to conserved linkage groups on mouse chromosomes 8 and 3, respectively, which correspond to the distal region of human chromosome 4q." As indicated background teachings on NPY and it associated receptors has been prepared by Victor A. McKusick et al (ibid). The following text concerning NPYR2 has been extracted from that source.	"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) signals through a family of G protein-coupled receptors present in the brain and sympathetic neurons. At least 3 types of neuropeptide Y receptor have been defined on the basis of pharmacologic criteria, tissue distribution, and structure of the encoding gene; see 162641 and 162643. Rose et al. (1995) reported the expression cloning in COS cells of a cDNA for the human type 2 receptor, NPY2R. Transfected cells showed high affinity for NPY (162640), peptide YY (PYY; 600781), and a fragment of NPY including amino acids 13 to 36. The predicted 381-amino acid protein has 7 transmembrane domains characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors and is only 31% identical to the human Y1 receptor (NPY1R; 162641). A 4-kb mRNA was detected on Northern blots of tissue samples from several regions of the nervous system. Gerald et al. (1995) cloned the cDNA corresponding to the human Y2 receptor from a human hippocampal cDNA expression library using a radiolabeled PYY-binding assay. They expressed the Y2 gene in COS-7 cells and performed a hormone-binding assay which showed that the Y2 receptor binds (from highest to lowest affinity) PYY, NPY, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP; 167780) hormones. Ammar et al. (1996) cloned and characterized the human gene encoding the type 2 NPY receptor. The transcript spans 9 kb of genomic sequence and is encoded in 2 exons. As in the type 1 NPY receptor gene, the 5-prime untranslated region of NPY2R is interrupted by a 4.5-kb intervening sequence. Ammar et al. (1996) demonstrated by Southern analysis of rodent-human cell hybrids followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) that the NPY2R gene maps to 4q31, the same region containing the NPY1R gene, suggesting that these subtypes may have arisen by gene duplication despite their structural differences. By interspecific backcross analysis, Lutz et al. (1997) mapped the Npy1r and Npy2r genes to conserved linkage groups on mouse chromosomes 8 and 3, respectively, which correspond to the distal region of human chromosome 4q."

Some of the experimental data concerning these compounds are presented in the Experimental section (infra).	EMI97.1	EMI98.1	EMI99.1	EMI100.1	VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide)	[0415] According to one aspect of the present invention, an additional target is a PcAMP target, which PcAMP target is VIP or one of its associated receptors. Current classification/nomenclature refers to these as VPAC1, VPAC2 and PACAP.	[0416] Nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences for VIP and its receptors are available in the literature. Some sequences are presented in the Sequence Listings provided herein.	[0417] We have shown that VPAC1and VPAC2 are present in human and rabbit vagina. PACAP was absent from both rabbit and human vagina.	[0418] VIP is a major endogenous neurotransmitter released during sexual arousal that is responsible for nerve-induced vaginal vasodilation of the vascular beds located in the vaginal wall. These vasodilatory effects are mediated by adenylate cyclase activation and cAMP production. Without wishing to be bound by theory, this effect may be mediated via VIP receptor subtypes VPAC1, VPAC2 or PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide) receptors. VPAC2 and PACAP receptors are most widely expressed in the CNS and the receptors despite being expressed in the pituitary, appears to have no widespread biological function.	[0419] The agent could potentiate VIP and/or act as a VIP mimetic or analogue thereof. The agent would then potentiate and/or mimic the vasorelaxant effects of endogenous VIP released during sexual arousal. The agent may also have an additive effect on VIP-induced relaxations of vaginal smooth muscle. Clinically this will lead to FSAD treatment, though increased vaginal lubrication via vaginal wall engorgement and compliance. In this embodiment, the mimetic or analogue would not have, however, the adverse properties of VIP as discussed supra.	[0420] Background teachings on VIP and it associated receptors are presented by Victor A. McKusick et al on http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/searchomim.htm. The following text concerning VIP has been extracted from that source.	"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a 28-amino acid peptide originally isolated from porcine duodenum, is present not only in gastrointestinal tissues but also in neural tissues, possibly as a neurotransmitter, and exhibits a wide variety of biological actions. Because VIP shows similarities to glucagon, secretin and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), it has been considered a member of the glucagon-secretin family. The primary translation product of the mRNA encoding VIP (prepro-VIP) has a molecular weight of 20 daltons. By cloning the DNA sequence complementary to the mRNA coding for human VIP, Itoh et al. (1983) found that the VIP precursor contains not only VIP but also a novel peptide of 27 amino acids, designated PHM27, that has aminoterminal histidine and carboxyterminal methionine. It differs from PHI17 isolated from porcine intestine by 2 amino acids; PHI27, as its designation indicates, has carboxyterminal isoleucine. Linder et al. (1987) isolated the human gene for VIP and PHM27 and studied its expression in various tissues of the rat. Heinz-Erian et al. (1985) suggested that deficient innovation of sweat glands of cystic fibrosis patients by the VIP neuropeptide might be a basic mechanism for the decreased water content and relative impermeability of the epithelium to chloride and other ions that characterize cystic fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, Gozes et al. (1987) took the 'candidate gene' approach. Bodner et al. (1985) had shown that VIP and PHM-27 are encoded by adjacent exons. Gozes et al. (1987) used the PHM-27-encoding genomic fragment to detect the presence of the VIP gene at 6q21-qter. Thus, they eliminated a defective VIP gene as a candidate for the primary cause of cystic fibrosis (which is coded by chromosome 7). By in situ hybridization techniques, Gozes et al. (1987) assigned the VIP gene to 6q24. This placed VIP in the region of MYB (189990), which has been mapped to 6q22. Gozes et al. (1987) investigated a functional relationship between the 2 genes in neuronal tissue. They observed a sharp peak of MYB mRNA in the hippocampus of 3-day-old rats, preceding the peak of VIP mRNA that occurs in this area at 8 days of age. Omary and Kagnoff (1987) found nuclear receptors for VIP in a human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line. Gotoh et al. (1988) assigned VIP to chromosome 6 by spot blot hybridization of a molecularly cloned fragment of the gene to sorted chromosomes. The localization was refined to 6q26-q27 by in situ hybridization."	[0421] As indicated, background teachings on VIP and it associated receptors are presented by Victor A. McKusick et al (ibid). The following text concerning VIPR1 or VPAC1 has been extracted from that source.	"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; 192320) is an octacosameric neuroendocrine mediator found predominantly in cholinergic presynaptic neurons of the central nervous system and in peripheral peptidergic neurons innervating diverse tissues. Of the many neuroendocrine peptides with immunologic functions, VIP is distinguished by its capacity to affect both B and T cells directly. Distinct subsets of neural, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune cells bear specific high-affinity receptors for VIP, which are associated with a guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein capable of activating adenylate cyclase. Libert et al. (1991) obtained 4 new receptors of the G protein-coupled receptor family by selective amplification and cloning from thyroid cDNA. One of these, termed RDC1, was identified as the VIP receptor by Sreedharan et al. (1991). Libert et al. (1991) mapped the VIPR gene to 2q37 by in situ hybridization. Later information made it doubtful that the gene mapped to 2q37 was in fact the VIP receptor gene (Vassart, 1992). The sequence that was designated GPRN1 by Sreedharan et al. (1991) and mapped to 2q37 was found not to bind VIP by Wenger (1993). Sreedharan et al. (1995) isolated an authentic type I VIP receptor gene and by fluorescence in situ hybridization localized it to the 3p22 band in a region associated with small-cell lung cancer. By interspecific backcross analysis, Hashimoto et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Vipr1 gene to the distal region of chromosome 9, a region that shows homology of synteny with human chromosome 3p. Sreedharan et al. (1993) cloned a human intestinal VIP receptor gene; the deduced amino acid sequence shares 84% identity with the rat lung VIP receptor. Couvineau et al. (1994) isolated 2 VIPR cDNA clones from a human jejunal epithelial cell cDNA library. One encodes a VIP receptor consisting of 460 amino acids and having 7 putative transmembrane domains, as do other G protein-coupled receptors. The other encodes a 495-amino acid VIP receptor-related protein exhibiting 100% homology with the functional VIP receptor over the 428 amino acids at the C-terminal region, but containing a completely divergent 67-amino acid N-terminal domain. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the second protein did not bind radioiodinated VIP, although it was normally addressed at the plasma membrane as assessed by immunofluorescence studies. The type I VIP receptor, also termed type II PACAP receptor (see 102981 for another type of PACAP receptor), was found by Sreedharan et al. (1995) to span approximately 22 kb and to be comprised of 13 exons (ranging from 42 to 1,400 bp) and 12 introns (ranging from 0.3 to 6.1 kb). Sreedharan et al. (1995) also characterized the promoter and the 5-prime flanking region of the gene."	[0422] As indicated, background teachings on VIP and it associated receptors are presented by Victor A. McKusick et al (ibid). The following text concerning VIPR2 or VPAC2 has been extracted from that source.	"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; 192320) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP; 102980) are homologous peptides that function as neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine hormones. While the receptors for VIP and PACAP share homology, they differ in their substrate specificities and expression patterns. See VIPR1 (192321) and ADCYAP1R1(102981). Svoboda et al. (1994) performed low stringency PCR using primers based on sequences conserved among VIP receptors. They cloned the human VIP2 receptor gene from a lymphoblast cDNA library. This gene encoded a 438-amino acid polypeptide that shares 86% identity with the rat VIP2 receptor. They expressed the human VIP2 receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells and found that it binds to PACAP-38, PACAP-27, VIP, and helodermin, and that binding of the receptor to any of these peptides activates adenylate cyclase. Peptide binding was found to be inhibited by GTP. Adamou et al. (1995) cloned the VIP2 receptor gene from a human placenta cDNA library. Northern blotting revealed that VIPR2 is expressed as 2 transcripts of 4.6 kb and 2.3 kb at high levels in skeletal muscle and at lower levels in heart, brain, placenta, and pancreas. Mackay et al. (1996) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the VIPR2 gene to human chromosome 7q36.3. Further mapping with cell lines derived from patients with holoprosencephaly type 3 (HPE3; 142945) revealed that the VIPR2 gene lies within the HPE3 minimal critical region. Mackay et al. (1996) stated that although VIPR2 may contribute to the HPE3 phenotype, it is not the sole factor responsible."	AC (adenylate cyclase)	[0423] According to one aspect of the present invention, an additional target is a PcAMP target, which PcAMP target is AC.	*[0424] Nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences for AC are available in the literature.	[0425] To confirm that VIP induces vasorelaxation via elevation of intracellular cAMP levels and consequent activation of adenylate cyclase we have measured vaginal cAMP concentrations during VIP stimulation and used forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, to mimic the effects of activating the cAMP/adenylate cyclase pathway.	[0426] In these studies, we found that VIP treatment and forskolin treatment elevate intracellular concentrations cAMP in isolated vaginal tissue.	[0427] We also found that forskolin increases vaginal blood flow in an animal model of sexual arousal.	[0428] Additionally we found that forskolin induces relaxation in isolated vagina.	[0429] Background teachings on AC are presented by Victor A. McKusick et al on http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/searchomim.htm. The following text concerning AC has been extracted from that source.	"Adenylyl cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1 ) catalyzes the transformation of ATP into cyclic AMP. The enzymatic activity is under the control of several hormones, and different polypeptides participate in the transduction of the signal from the receptor to the catalytic moiety. Stimulatory or inhibitory receptors (Rs and Ri) interact with G proteins (Gs and Gi) that exhibit GTPase activity and they modulate the activity of the catalytic subunit of the adenylyl cyclase. Parma et al. (1991) cloned a cDNA corresponding to human brain adenylyl cyclase, symbolized by them as HBAC1. By in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomal spreads using the human brain cDNA probe, Stengel et al. (1992) showed that the gene is located on 8q24.2. A highly homologous gene, ADCY2 (103071), was assigned to 5p15.3 by the same method."	GENERAL RECOMBINANT DNA METHODOLOGY TECHNIQUES	[0430] Although in general the techniques mentioned herein are well known in the art, reference may be made in particular to Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (1989) and Ausubel et al., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology (1999) 4th Ed, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. PCR is described in US-A-4683195, US-A-4800195 and US-A-4965188.	SUMMARY	[0431] In summation, the present invention relates to the use of an I:NEP to treat FSD, in particular FSAD.	EXAMPLES	[0432] The present invention will now be described, by way of example only, in which reference is made to the following Figures:	Figure 1 which is a graph;	Figure 2 which is a graph;	Figure 3 which is a graph;	Figure 4 which is a graph;	Figure 5 which is a graph;	Figure 6 which is a graph;	
EP1481667_0017	Figure 7 which is a graph;	Figure 8 which is a graph;	Figure 9 which is a graph;	Figure 10 which is a graph;	Figure 11 which is a graph; and	Figure 12 which is a graph.	[0433] It is to be understood that the agent of the present invention is an I:NEP. Teachings on I:PDE and I:NPY are also presented as these would clearly indicate to a skilled person that the agent of the present invention could be used in combination with one or both of these types of agents to achieve the benefial effect mentioned herein. These additional teachings are also included to further support our seminal findings.	[0434] The Figures will now be discussed in more detail.	Figure 1:- Electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve induces a frequency-dependent increase in vaginal blood flow in the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal. Increasing the stimulation frequency induces larger increases in blood flow. Changes were monitored using laser Doppler technologies.	Figure 2:- Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induces increases in vaginal blood flow in the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal. Figure 2a illustrates how vaginal blood flow is increased in a concentration dependent manner by infusions of VIP (intravenous bolus). Figure 2b demonstrates that 2 repetitive infusions of VIP produce similar increases in blood flow. Note the duration of the response is also similar. All changes were monitored using laser Doppler technologies.	Figure 3:- Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) reduces the mean arterial blood pressure in the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal. This graph illustrates the typical effects of the vasoactive agents and stimulation parameters used to investigate vagina blood flow on mean arterial pressure in an anaesthetised rabbit. These observed effects are typical of the trends seen in all animals tested. VIP induced a significant depression of mean arterial pressure whereas pelvic nerve stimulation, control infusions of Hepsaline or inhibitors of PDEcAMP or NEP have no effect on blood pressure. Note, the reduction in blood pressure associated with VIP infusions is also associated with a large increase in heart rate.	Figure 4:- Activation of the cAMP/adenylate cyclase pathway mimics VIP mediated vasorelaxation and smooth muscle relaxation in vaginal tissue. Figure 4a illustrates that an infusion of forskolin (40nmol/kg iv bolus, a cAMPmimetic) induces significant increases in vaginal blood flow. Note the amplitude and duration of the response is similar to that induced by VIP (20.0 mu g/kg, iv bolus). Interestingly, the effects on blood flow have a longer duration of action on the external vaginal wall. All changes were monitored using laser Doppler technologies. Figure 4b demonstrates that both VIP (0.1 mu M) and forskolin (10 mu M) significantly elevate intracellular concentrations of cAMP above basal levels in the rabbit vagina. Figure 4c shows that forskolin induces potent relaxations of precontracted (1 mu M phenylephrine) rabbit vaginal strips with an IC50 SIMILAR 300nM. All changes were quantified using in vivo laser Doppler technologies, biochemical cAMP enzyme immunoassay or by in vitro tissue relaxation.	Figure 5:- Infusion of VIP increases clitoral blood flow and activation of the cAMP/adenylate cyclase pathway mimics VIP mediated clitoral vasorelaxation in the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal. Infusion of VIP (60-200 mu g/kg) induces a concentration dependant increase in clitoral blood flow. A 115% increase in clitoral blood flow was observed after an iv infusion of 200 mu g/kg VIP. The effects of VIP on clitoral blood flow can be mimicked by an infusion of a cAMP mimetic forskolin (FSK, 40nmol/kg iv bolus). A 156% increase in clitoral blood flow was observed after an iv infusion of 40nmol/kg forskolin. All increases were significantly elevated from control infusions (Hepsaline). Note the amplitude of the response is similar to that induced by VIP (200 mu g/kg, iv bolus) and comparable to those observed on vaginal blood flow in Figs 2 and 4. All changes were quantified using in vivo laser Doppler technologies and were significantly increased when compared to vehicle infusions (Hepsaline).	Figure 6:- A selective inhibitor of NEP EC 3.4.24.11 enhances pelvic nerve stimulated (PNS) increases in vaginal blood flow in the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal. Repetitive PNS at 15 minute intervals induces reproducible increases in vaginal blood flow (White bar). Administration of a NEP inhibitor (Grey bar) enhanced the peak increase in vaginal blood flow induced by submaximal stimulation frequencies (eg 4Hz) compared to increases observed during time matched control stimulations or vehicle controls (Hatched bar). The following dose dependant enhancements were observed - 0.3mg/kg iv induced a 40% increase and 1.0mg/kg iv induced a 91% increase (mean n=3). The NEP inhibitor had no effect on basal (unstimulated) vaginal blood flow (Data not shown). All changes were monitored using laser Doppler technologies.	Figure 7:- Selective inhibitors of NEP EC 3.4.24.11 enhance VIP-induced increases in vaginal blood flow in the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal. Repetitive infusions of VIP at 30 minute intervals induce reproducible increases in vaginal blood flow (See figure 2b). An NEP inhibitor both potentiates the amplitude and prolongs the duration of enhanced blood flow when these increases are induced by submaximal doses of VIP e.g. 6.0 mu g/kg. At doses of VIP which induce maximal increases in vaginal blood flow eg 60 mu g/kg, NEP inhibitors only potentiate the duration of enhanced vaginal blood flow. VIP-induced increase in the presence of a NEP inhibitor are shown as closed triangles whereas control VIP responses are shown as open triangles. A control infusion of Hepsaline has no effect on the amplitude of the responses. All changes were monitored using laser Doppler technologies.	Figure 8:- A selective inhibitor of PDEcAMP type 2 enhances pelvic nerve stimulated (PNS) increases in vaginal blood flow in the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal. Repetitive PNS at 15 minute intervals induces reproducible increases in vaginal blood flow (White squares). Administration of a PDEcAMP type 2 inhibitor enhanced the peak increase in vaginal blood flow induced by submaximal stimulation frequencies (Black squares; at 4Hz) compared to increases observed during time matched control stimulations (Open squares). An infusion of the PDE2 inhibitor (500 mu g/kg) induced a 86.8+/-21.9% enhancement in vaginal blood flow (mean+/-sem n=2). All changes were monitored using laser Doppler technologies.	Figure 9:- Selective inhibitors of PDEcAMP type 2 enhance VIP-induced increases in vaginal blood flow in the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal. Repetitive infusions of VIP at 30 minute intervals induce reproducible increases in vaginal blood flow (See figure 2b). A selective PDEcAMP type 2 inhibitor (25 mu g/kg iv bolus) potentiates the duration of enhanced vaginal blood flow induced by VIP (60 mu g/kg iv bolus). VIP-induced increases in the presence of a PDEcAMP inhibitor are shown as closed triangles whereas control VIP responses are shown as open triangles. A control infusion of Hepsaline had no effect on the amplitude of the responses. All changes were monitored using Laser Doppler technologies.	Figure 10:- A selective antagonist of NPY Y1 receptors enhances pelvic nerve stimulated (PNS) increases in vaginal blood flow in the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal. Repetitive PNS at 15 minute intervals induces reproducible increases in vaginal blood flow (data not shown). Administration of a NPY Y1 antagonist (Grey bar) enhanced the peak increase in vaginal blood flow induced by submaximal stimulation frequencies (eg 4Hz) compared to increases observed during time matched control stimulations or in vehicle controls (Hatched bar). The following dose dependant enhancements were observed - 0.01 mg/kg iv induced a 15.8+/-19.6% increase; 0.03mg/kg iv induced a 35.1+/-17.17% increase; 0.10mg/kg iv induced a 60.1+/-16.9% increase and 0.3mg/kg iv induced a 91.9+/-27.4% increase (mean+/-sem n=3). The NPY Y1 antagonist had no effect on basal (unstimulated) vaginal blood flow (Data not shown). All changes were monitored using laser Doppler technologies.	Figure 11 provides a summary graph for some of the data provided herein showing that the agents are very useful in increasing vaginal blood flow by potentiating endogenous cAMP levels.	Figure 12:- A selective inhibitor of NEP EC 3.4.24.11 enhances pelvic nerve stimulated (PNS) increases in clitoral blood flow in the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal. Administration of a NEP inhibitor (Grey bar) enhanced the peak increase in clitoral blood flow induced by submaximal stimulation frequencies (eg 4Hz) compared to increases observed during time matched control stimulations or vehicle controls (Hatched bar). The following dose dependant enhancements were observed - 1.0mg/kg iv induced a 131% increase (mean n=3). The NEP inhibitor had no effect on basal (unstimulated) clitoral blood flow. All changes were monitored using laser Doppler technologies.	AN ASSAY FOR MEASURING cAMP ACTIVITY/LEVELS	[0435] Measurement of cAMP from vaginal tissue samples using a Biotrak cAMP Enzymeimmunoassay (EIA) kit (Amersham Life Sciences RPN 225).	[0436] cAMP levels are measured by EIA in vaginal tissue samples. The EIA is based on competition between unlabelled cAMP and a fixed quantity of peroxidase labelled cAMP for a limited amount of cAMP specific antibody.	1. MATERIALS	[0437] All materials are supplied by Amersham Life Science cAMP EIA kit (RPN 225) unless otherwise stated.	1.1 Microtitre plate - 96 well plate coated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG.	1.2 Assay buffer - 0.05M sodium acetate buffer pH5.8 containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% preservative upon reconstitution.

SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT	2.1 Disposable 5ml glass test tubes	2.2 Spectrophotometric plate reader (Spectra max 190)	2.3 Microtitre plate shaker (Luckham R100)	3. METHODS	Tissue sample preparation. The tissues were treated with the relevant pretreatment in 5ml samples of physiological salt solution eg agonists, cAMPmimetics etc. After treatment the samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then smashed using a hammer. The powder was scraped into a centrifuge tube and 1ml of 0.5M ice cold perchloric acid (PCA) was added. The sample was vortex mixed and left on ice for 1 hr.	cAMP extraction from tissue samples. The samples were centrifuged at 10000g for 5 min at 4 DEG C. The supernatant was removed and placed in other centrifuge tubes. The pellet was keep for protein analysis at -80 DEG C. The supernatant samples were then neutralised to pH SIMILAR 6 using K3PO4. Centrifuged at 10000g for 5 min at 4 DEG C. Recover supernatant and wash 4 times with 5 volumes (5ml) of water saturated diethyl ether. The upper ether layer should be discarded after each wash. Transfer aqueous to into a short thin glass tube and dry under a steam of nitrogen at 60 DEG C. Dissolve dried extract in 1ml of assay buffer and store in refrigerator until required (or can be frozen).	Stock reagents are equilibrated to room temperature and working solutions then prepared	cAMP standards are prepared in glass tubes labelled 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512fmol. This is achieved by adding 1ml of assay buffer to all tubes except the 512fmol standard. 1ml of acetylation standard (10.24pmol/ml) is then added to the two top standards (256, and 512fmol). The 256fmol standard is vortexed and 1ml transferred to the 128fmol standard. his is continued until the 2fmol standard where 1ml of solution is disposed of. A zero standard tube is set up containing 1ml of assay buffer.	Tissue extract samples are thawed on ice (if necessary) and diluted 1 in 100 (10 mu l sample to 990 mu l assay buffer) in labelled glass tubes.	The cAMP in all standards and samples is acetylated by the addition of 100 mu l of acetylation reagent in a fume hood which is added down the side of the tube before immediately vortexing.	50 mu l of all standards and samples are added to the appropriate wells of the 96 well plate, and 150 mu l of assay buffer is added to non specific binding (NSB) wells.	100 mu l of antiserum is added to all wells except blanks (B) and NSB before incubating for 2 hours at 3-5 DEG C.	After incubation, 100 mu l of cAMP-peroxidase conjugate is added to all wells except B before a further 1 hour incubation at 3-5 DEG C.	
EP1481667_0018	Plates are emptied by turning them upside down and blotting onto absorbent paper before washing each well four times with 400 mu l of wash buffer. After each wash plates are re-blotted to ensure any residual wash buffer is removed. 200 mu l TMB is then immediately dispensed into all wells.	Plates are put on a plate shaker for 30 minutes at room temperature before the addition of 100 mu l of 1M sulphuric acid into all wells. The optical density is read on Spectra max 190 at 450nm within 30 minutes.	4. STANDARDS	[0441] With each assay the following standard tubes are set up:-	4.1 Spiking a standard in assay buffer	[0442] A known amount of cAMP is spiked into assay buffer to determine the efficiency of the assay. 70pmol/ml of cAMP is added to assay buffer which is equivalent to 35fmol/well in the assay, which is in the middle of the dose response curve.	[0443] To make up 1ml of standard:- 68.4 mu l 521fmol/well standard	931.6 mu l Assay buffer	4. Effects of compounds on plate	[0444] Standards are set up to determine whether the compound used in the functionalstudies has any effect on the 96 well plate or affects the binding of cAMP. These include:-	Spiking the compound into assay buffer alone to assess the effects of the compound directly on the plate.	Spiking the compound into plasma containing basal levels of cAMP to assess the effects of the compound on the binding of cAMP to the plate.	[0445] 5nM concentrations of compound are spiked into each standard. 5nM is chosen because total drug levels at the end of infusion have in the past been approximately 150-300nM. Samples are diluted 1:100 before being assayed, therefore 5nM allows for any larger than expected total drug concentrations at the end of infusion.	5. CALCULATIONS	[0446] The Spectra max plate reader reads the optical density (OD) at 450nm.	[0447] The standard curve is generated by plotting the %B/Bo (y axis) against cAMP fmol/well (x axis) on Spectra max.	[0448] %B/B0 (% bound) for each sample and standard is calculated as follows:-	Bo = zero standard (see methods 3.2)	%B/Bo = (standard or sample OD-NSB OD) DIVIDED (Bo OD-NSB OD) x100	[0449] The fmol/well volume can then be read directly from the standard curve for each sample.

To develop and validate an animal model of female sexual arousal.	2. To identify the mechanism(s) responsible for the regulation of genital blood flow in the anaesthetised rabbit.	3. To identify potential approaches for enhancement of vaginal and clitoral blood flow.	4. To investigate the mechanism(s) that underlie relaxation of vaginal smooth muscle and to identify potential approaches for enhancement of vaginal relaxation.	2.0 Introduction	[0453] The normal sexual arousal response consists of a number of physiological responses that are observed during sexual excitement. These changes such as vaginal, labial and clitoral engorgement result from increases in genital blood flow. Engorgement leads to increased vaginal lubrication via plasma transudation, increased vaginal compliance (relaxation of vaginal smooth muscle) and increases in vaginal and clitoral sensitivity.	[0454] Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is a highly prevalent sexual disorder affecting up to 40% of pre-, peri- and postmenopausal (+/-HRT) women. The primary consequence of FSAD is reduced genital engorgement or swelling which manifests itself as a lack of vaginal lubrication and a lack of pleasurable genital sensation. Secondary consequences include reduced sexual desire, pain during intercourse and difficulty in achieving orgasm. The most common cause of FSAD is decreased genital blood flow resulting in reduced vaginal, labial and clitoral engorgement. (Park, 1997; Goldstein, 1998; Berman, 1999a, Werbin, 1999).	[0455] As explained herein, the present invention provides a means for restoring or potentiating the normal sexual arousal response in women suffering from FSAD, by enhancing genital blood flow.	[0456] In our studies, we have identified cAMP (cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate) as a mediator of vaginal vasorelaxation using laser Doppler technology to measure small changes in genital blood flow. Using an inhibitor of VIP metabilism (a NEP EC3.4.24.11 inhibitor), we have also demonstrated that the increases in genital blood flow observed during pelvic nerve stimulation (ie sexual arousal) are mediated by VIP. This has involved developing an animal model of sexual arousal and demonstrating that the data reflects the physiological changes observed during female sexual arousal. The model has then been used to identify and validate mechanisms that enhance genital blood flow eg. direct or indirect potentiation of cAMP-mediated vasorelaxation.	3.0 Methods	3.1 Anaesthetic Protocol	[0457] Female New Zealand rabbits ( SIMILAR 2.5kg) were pre-medicated with a combination of Medetomidine (Domitor TM ) 0.5ml/kg i.m., and Ketamine (Vetalar TM ) 0.25ml/kg i.m. whilst maintaining oxygen intake via a face mask. The rabbits were tracheotomised using a Portex TM uncuffed endotracheal tube 3 ID., connected to ventilator and maintained at a ventilation rate of 30-40 breaths per minute, with an approximate tidal volume of 18-20 ml, and a maximum airway pressure of 10 cm H2O. Anaesthesia was then switched to Isoflurane and ventilation continued with O2 at 2l/min. The right marginal ear vein was cannulated using a 23G or 24G catheter, and Lactated Ringer solution perfused at 0.5ml/min. The rabbit was maintained at 3% Isoflurane during invasive surgery, dropping to 2% for maintenance anaesthesia.	3.2 Cannulation of Vessels	[0458] The left groin area of the rabbit was shaved and a vertical incision was made approximately 5cm in length along the thigh. The femoral vein and artery were exposed, isolated and then cannulated with a PVC catheter (17G) for the infusion of drugs and compounds. Cannulation was repeated for the femoral artery, inserting the catheter to a depth of 10cm to ensure that the catheter reached the abdominal aorta. This arterial catheter was linked to a Gould system to record blood pressure. Samples for blood gas analysis were also taken via the arterial catheter. Systolic and diastolic pressures were measured, and the mean arterial pressure calculated using the formula (diastolic x2 + systolic) DIVIDED 3. Heart rate was measured via the pulse oxymeter and Po-ne-mah data acquisition software system (Ponemah Physiology Platform, Gould Instrument Systems Inc).	3.3 Stimulation of the Pelvic Nerve	[0459] A ventral midline incision was made into the abdominal cavity. The incision was about 5cm in length just above the pubis. The fat and muscle was bluntly dissected away to reveal the hypogastric nerve which runs down the body cavity. It was essential to keep close to the side curve of the pubis wall in order to avoid damaging the femoral vein and artery which lie above the pubis. The sciatic and pelvic nerves lie deeper and were located after further dissection on the dorsal side of the rabbit. Once the sciatic nerve is identified, the pelvic nerve was easily located. The term pelvic nerve is loosely applied; anatomy books on the subject fail to identify the nerves in sufficient detail. However, stimulation of the nerve causes an increase in vaginal and clitoral blood flow, and innervation of the pelvic region. The pelvic nerve was freed away from surrounding tissue and a Harvard bipolar stimulating electrode was placed around the nerve. The nerve was slightly lifted to give some tension, then the electrode was secured in position. Approximately 1ml of light paraffin oil was placed around the nerve and electrode. This acts as a protective lubricant to the nerve and prevents blood contamination of the electrode. The electrode was connected to a Grass S88 Stimulator. The pelvic nerve was stimulated using the following parameters:- 5V, pulse width 0.5ms, duration of stimulus 10 seconds and a frequency range of 2 to 16Hz. Reproducible responses were obtained when the nerve was stimulated every 15-20 minutes.	[0460] A frequency response curve was determined at the start of each experiment in order to determine the optimum frequency to use as a sub-maximal response, normally 4Hz. The compound(s) to be tested were infused, via the femoral vein, using a Harvard 22 infusion pump allowing a continuous 15 minute stimulation cycle.	3. 4 Positioning of the Laser Doppler Probes	[0461] A ventral midline incision was made, at the caudal end of the pubis, to expose the pubic area. Connective tissue was removed to expose the tunica of the clitoris, ensuring that the wall was free from small blood vessels. The external vaginal wall was also exposed by removing any connective tissue. One laser Doppler flow probe was inserted 3cm into the vagina, so that half the probe shaft was still visible. A second probe was positioned so that it lay just above the external clitoral wall. The position of these probes was then adjusted until a signal was obtained. A second probe was placed just above the surface of a blood vessel on the external vaginal wall. Both probes were clamped in position.	[0462] Vaginal and clitoral blood flow was recorded either as numbers directly from the Flowmeter using Po-ne-mah data acquisition software (Ponemah Physiology Platform, Gould Instrument Systems Inc), or indirectly from Gould chart recorder trace. Calibration was set at the beginning of the experiment (0-125ml/min/100g tissue).	
EP1481667_0019	3.5 Infusion of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP)	[0463] The doses of VIP (Bachem, H-3775) infused were 2.0, 6.0, 20.0, 60.0 mu g/kg iv. and were infused in a volume of 0.5 ml of saline. VIP was infused using a Harvard 22 pump, infusing at 500 mu l/min via a 3-way tap into the femoral vein. After VIP infusion, the catheter was flushed with heparinised saline (Hepsaline) so that no VIP was left in the catheter.	[0464] For experiments using VIP infusions, there was a need for an initial sensitising dose response curve (2-60 mu g/kg), in order that reproducible responses could be obtained. An initial infusion of Hepsaline (50UI/ml) was infused to act as a negative control.	3.6 Infusion of Inhibitors	[0465] NEP (Neutral Endopeptidase EC3.4.24.11) inhibitors, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors and NPY Y1 antagonists were made up in saline or 5% glucose solution (200 mu l 50% glucose in 1.8ml water for injection). PDEcAMP inhibitors were dissolved in a 40% ethanol solution (200 mu l 50% glucose in 1.8ml water/ethanol for injection). The inhibitors and vehicle controls were infused at the same rate as VIP. NEP inhibitors were left for 30 minutes prior to a VIP dose response curve, whilst NEP inhibitors, NPY Y1 receptor antagonists and PDEcAMP inhibitors were left for 15 minutes prior to pelvic nerve stimulation.	3.7 Measurement of smooth muscle relaxation in isolated rabbit vagina	3.7 (a). Rabbit vagina in vitro preparation:- Female New Zealand white rabbits (2.0 - 3.0 kg) were killed by cervical dislocation. The abdominal cavity was opened and the vagina excised. Tissue strips were mounted longitudinally in Wesley Co. 5ml silanised organ chambers with braided silk sutures (6/0 gauge) at an initial resting tension of 1.5g in Krebs bicarbonate buffer maintained at 37 DEG C and gassed with 95%O2/5%CO2. The upper ligature of each tissue strip was attached to a 10g capacity force-displacement transducer and changes in isometric force were measured and recorded using a DART in vitro data capture system. Tissues were allowed to equilibrate for 1.5 hours and were regularly washed with Krebs.	3.7 (b). Vasoactive intestinal peptide-induced relaxation of rabbit vagina:- Each tissue was contracted using 1 mu M bath concentration of phenylephrine. When the contractile response reached a stable plateau ( SIMILAR 15 minutes), VIP was cumulatively added to the organ chamber at log units to produce concentrations from 0.1 - 100nM. The relaxation responses were measured 5 minutes after the addition of each concentration of VIP; maximum relaxation was achieved by this time. Tissues then received either a test agent (eg NEP or PDE inhibitor) or DMSO vehicle (time matched control).	3.7 (c). Analysis of data for VIP relaxation experiments:- For each VIP concentration relaxation-response curve, the relaxation responses induced by VIP were expressed as a percentage of the maximum phenylephrine induced contraction. These values were then plotted against log VIP concentration and sigmoidal curves were fitted. For the purpose of curve fitting the minimum relaxation response was constrained to 0 % and the maximum relaxation response was allowed to free fit. The concentration of VIP required to produce 50 % relaxation of the phenylephrine contraction (EC50 PE) was determined.	3.7 (d). Electrical field stimulated relaxation of rabbit vagina:- Rabbit vaginal strips were prepared as described in Section 3.7 (a). The tissue strips were mounted between two platinum electrodes placed at the top and bottom of the organ chamber approximately 4cm apart. Each tissue was contracted using 1 mu M bath concentration of phenylephrine. When the contractile response reached a stable plateau (15 minutes), the tissues underwent a pre-treatment electrical field stimulated (EFS) induced relaxation curve. This was performed between 40 - 60 volts using sequential frequencies of 2, 4, 8 and 16 Hz delivered as 10 second trains of 0.5 milli second pulse width. The tissues were allowed to return to base line pre-contractile tension between each frequency (5 minutes) and the size of the relaxation response recorded.	[0467] After completion of the pre-treatment EFS response curve, all tissues were washed for 15 minutes, allowing the tissues to return to the baseline tension. Tissues then received either a test agent (eg NEP or PDE inhibitor, nitric oxide synthase [NOS] inhibitor) or DMSO vehicle (time matched control). Tissues were re-contracted with phenylephrine (1 mu M) 15 minutes after the addition of compound or vehicle and an EFS-induced relaxation response curve determined as described above.	[0468] For EFS experiments the Krebs was supplemented with atropine (10 mu M) and guanethidine (150 mu M) to abolish any cholinergic or adrenergic neuronal innervations of the vagina.	3.8 Measurement of cAMP levels in isolated rabbit vagina	[0469] Measurement of cAMP concentrations were made from vaginal tissue extracts using a Biotrak cAMP Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (Amersham Life Sciences RPN 225).	[0470] Isolated vaginal tissue samples were treated with test agents (eg forskolin or VIP). After 5 minutes the samples were snap frozen using liquid nitrogen, homogenised and cAMP was extracted. cAMP levels are measured by EIA. The EIA is based on competition between unlabelled cAMP and a fixed quantity of peroxidase labelled cAMP for a limited amount of cAMP specific antibody.	3.9 Measurement of phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity in isolated rabbit vagina	[0471] Human vaginal wall cytosol extracts were obtained from ABS Inc., Delaware (Age of donors 41 and 60 years old). The PDE isoenzymes were separated by Mono-Q anion exchange chromatography and characterised based upon their substrate selectivity, sensitivity to allosteric modulators and selective inhibitors. Western analysis using specific PDE isoenzyme antibodies was also performed to detect PDE expression in the human vagina.	[0472] All data are reported as mean +/- s.e.m.. Significant changes were identified using Student's t-tests.	4.0 Results and Discussion	4.1 Animal model of sexual arousal	[0473] In our studies, we have developed a robust reproducible model of the physiology of sexual arousal. Using this anaesthetised rabbit model, we are capable of measuring small changes in genital blood flow using Laser Doppler technology. Stimulation of the pelvic nerve is used to simulate the neuronal effects of sexual arousal.	[0474] We found that stimulation of the pelvic nerve induces frequency-dependent increases in vaginal and clitoral blood flow (See Figure 1). The increases in vaginal blood flow are significant when recorded either on the intra- or extra-vaginal wall. Stimulation of the pelvic nerve at 2Hz induced a mean maximum vaginal blood flow elevation of 10.3+/-1.8, at 4Hz 20.0+/-4.6, 8Hz 36.3+/-4.8 and 16Hz 46.6+4.7 ml/min/100g tissue (n=4); 15-20V, 0.5ms, 10s) and increases in clitoral blood flow of 14.7+/-3.6 at 2Hz, 29.4+/-1.4 at 4Hz and 69.7+/-2.1 at 8Hz. These values are of similar amplitude to those previously observed in human studies and animal models of arousal (Berman, 1999a; Park, 1997).	[0475] We found that submaximal stimulation of the pelvic nerve results in reproducible increases in genital blood flow (eg stimulating 4Hz every 15 minutes gave a mean increase of in vaginal blood flow of 8.50+/-0.10ml/min/100g tissue n=8 and a mean increase in clitoral blood flow of 13.65+/-0.86ml/min/100g tissue n=11). This reproducibility is maintained for up to 5 hours. We can use the reproducibility of these responses to investigate a.) the identity of endogenous vasoactive agents/mechanisms which mediate genital engorgement, and b.) the influence of drugs which may be efficacious in enhancing vaginal and/or clitoral blood flow.	[0476] We found that there are no adverse cardiovascular effects associated with pelvic nerve stimulation in the anaesthetised rabbit (See Figure 3).	[0477] Genital blood flow is increased during sexual arousal (Berman, 1999) via an increased arterial blood supply - the vaginal artery, the vaginal branch of the uterine artery, the internal pudendal artery and the middle branches of the middle rectal artery are all involved in supplying blood to the vagina and clitoris. The pelvic nerve which originates from S2/S4 spinal regions, innervates the female genitalia and has branches terminating in the lower vagina, clitoris and related blood vessels. By stimulating the pelvic nerve we can simulate the blood flow effects observed during sexual arousal i.e. an increase in arterial genital blood flow. Interestingly, the increased arterial blood flow is not mirrored by venous drainage allowing the capillary networks to become engorged with blood. Vaginal engorgement leads to vaginal lubrication, via increased plasma transudation and this is one of the first pelvic responses observed during sexual stimulation. The neurotransmitters that are released upon pelvic nerve stimulation or during sexual arousal are currently unidentified. Nerves containing neuropeptides and other neurotransmitter candidates that innervate the vasculature and microvasculature of the vagina and clitoris have been identified immunohistochemically. These studies indicate that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are all present in the nerves that innervate the human vagina and clitoris (Hoyle, 1996; Burnett, 1997; Hauser-Kronberger, 1999).	4.2 Validation of the anaesthetised rabbit model of sexual arousal	[0478] In order to translate blood flow data generated using this model to those observed in a human model of sexual arousal, we directly compared our data with vaginal blood flow and cardiovascular data generated in pre-clinical studies.	[0479] We found that VIP infusion has the following effects in rabbit model of sexual arousal:-	Exogenous VIP (iv bolus) induces significant concentration-dependent increases in vaginal blood flow (See Figure 2a). These increases are significantly elevated above basal blood flow values when recorded either on the intra- or extra-vaginal wall. Vaginal blood flow was significantly increased by 24.7+/-3.6ml/min/100g tissue with an intravenous administration of VIP (60 mu g/kg). The blood flow remained elevated above basal for about 11 minutes post-infusion. Lower doses induced smaller increases eg 6.0 mu g/kg, elevated blood flow by 7.5+/-1.3ml/min/100g tissue and blood flow was elevated for 7 minutes post-infusion.	Repetitive infusions of similar doses of VIP (iv at 30 minute intervals) induce significant reproducible increases in vaginal blood flow (See Figure 2b).	VIP (iv) significantly increases heart rate and decreases mean arterial blood pressure (See Figure 3). At 6.0 mu g/kg VIP (iv) caused significant reduction in mean arterial blood pressure of 13.2+/-0.7mm Hg and a significant increase in heart rate of 16+/-4 beats per minute.	[0480] This animal model directly reflects the clinical data observed upon infusion of VIP into health volunteers ie increased vaginal blood flow, suppressed blood pressure and elevated heart rate. Therefore this model can be used to investigate the mechanism(s) that underlie physiological changes that occur during sexual arousal and additionally to validate novel approaches for the enhancement of vaginal blood flow and hence treatment of FSAD.	4.3 VIP-induces changes in vaginal blood flow via stimulation of the cAMP/adenylate cyclase pathway	[0481] Ottesen and co-workers demonstrated that VIP induces increases in vaginal blood flow and lubrication in healthy volunteers. However the mechanism by which VIP exerts it's effects are unclear. In the literature, there are plenty of examples of VIP signalling through different second messenger systems including cGMP/guanylate cyclase (Ashur-Fabian, 1999), carbon monoxide/heme oxygenase (Fan, 1998) and cAMP/adenylate cyclase (Schoeffter, 1985; Gu, 1992; Foda, 1995). This is exemplified by a recent report which describes how the relaxant effects of VIP in the uterine artery can be explained by the release of nitric oxide (Jovanovic, 1998). Interestingly there is also evidence for VIP modulating NO/cGMP in male urogenital function (Kim, 1994) and there is direct evidence that treatment of human vaginal smooth muscles cell cultures, with VIP (0.5 mu M) fails to elevate cAMP levels (Traish, 1999 ibid).	[0482] In this study we have shown that VIP induces vasorelaxation via elevation of intracellular cAMP levels. By conducting a series of functional experiments we have measured blood flow and smooth muscle relaxation in addition to biochemically measuring intracellular cAMP concentrations. We have used forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase or cAMPmimetic, to mimic the effects of activating the cAMP/adenylate cyclase pathway. VIP and forskolin have identical effects on the physiological arousal effects on vaginal blood flow and relaxation.	[0483] VIP (20 mu g/kg) and forskolin (40nmol/kg) induces significant increases in vaginal blood flow 13.2 and 12.7ml/min/100mg tissue respectively (See figures 2a and 4a). These changes in amplitude induced by VIP and forskolin were not significantly different. These increases are significantly elevated above basal blood flow values when recorded either on the intra- or extra-vaginal wall.	[0484] VIP (0.1 mu M) and forskolin (10 mu M) both significantly increased intracellular concentrations cAMP above basal levels in isolated vaginal tissue (See Figure 4b).	[0485] VIP (0.1 mu M) and forskolin (10 mu M) elevate basal concentrations from 276nM by 156% and 238% respectively. The differences in these percentages reflects the difference in concentrations of VIP and forskolin used eg VIP at a concentration of 0.1 mu M relaxes precontracted isolated vagina by circa 80% where as 10 mu M forskolin is sufficient to completely relax isolated tissue.	[0486] Additionally we showed that VIP and forskolin induces relaxation in isolated vaginal tissue with EC50 values of 18.8+/-0.6nM and 320+/-20nM respectively (See Figure 4c).	[0487] These data establish that VIP induces vaginal vasorelaxation via the cAMP/adenylate cyclase pathway, hence this model can be used to investigate whether pelvic nerve stimulation, i.e. sexual arousal, leads to the release of VIP/activation of the cAMP/adenylate cyclase pathway. In addition, approaches to enhance vaginal blood flow during sexual arousal, eg by directly or indirectly enhancing cAMP signalling, can also be investigated.	4.4 cAMP is the mediator of vaginal vasorelaxation	[0488] The neurotransmitter and second messenger candidates responsible for increases in vaginal blood flow during sexual arousal are currently unidentified. Todate, workers have focused on the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP pathway. In accordance with the present invention, we have demonstrated that:- 1.) the cAMP/adenylate cyclase pathway mediates VIP-induced increases in vaginal blood flow; 2.) VIP is the endogenous neurotransmitter released during sexual arousal and 3.) endogenously released VIP induces it's vasorelaxant effects via elevation of cAMP.	[0489] The neurotransmitter responsible for vaginal wall relaxation is currently unidentified. We have shown that VIP is the neurotransmitter release upon stimulation of the pelvic nerve and that cAMP mediates the VIP-mediated vasorelaxation. Agents that prevent the metabolism of VIP or directly enhance cAMP signalling enhance pelvic nerve stimulated increases in vaginal blood flow eg NEP inhibitors or PDEcAMP inhibitors respectively (see following sections).	[0490] In our studies, we have found that we can exclude a role for NO in VIP-induced vaginal relaxation. A potent and selective PDE type 5 inhibitor has a minimal effect on VIP- induced-relaxations of isolated vaginal smooth muscle (30% enhancement of VIP-induced relaxations; See table 1).	<TABLE> Id=Table 1:- Columns=2	Enhancement of VIP mediated relaxation of isolated rabbit vagina. This table illustrated the percentage enhancement of the EC50 for VIP-induced relaxations of precontracted vaginal smooth muscle (1 mu M phenylephrine). Selective inhibitors of PDEcAMP types 1, 2, 3 and 4 all significantly potentiated VIP-mediated relaxations whereas a selective inhibitor of PDEcGMP type 5 or vehicle control had no effect on VIP-mediated relaxations.	Head Col 1: PDE inhibitor at selective dose	Head Col 2: Percentage enhancement of VIP-induced relaxation	PDEcAMP type 1 210%	PDEcAMP type 2 130%	
EP1481667_0020	PDEcAMP type 3 220%	PDEcAMP type 4 160%	PDEcGMP type 5 No effect (30%)	Control - vehicle No effect	</TABLE>	[0491] We have shown that VIP is also the endogenous NANC (non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic) neurotransmitter partially responsible for EFS-induced relaxations of isolated vaginal smooth muscle. A high dose of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NOARG, 300 mu M) only inhibits 50% of EFS-induced relaxations. A NEP inhibitor (1 mu M), which will prevent NEP-induced metabolism of VIP and hence enhance VIP signalling, enhances the non-nitric oxide NANC relaxation induced by EFS. We have shown that both NO and VIP regulate smooth muscle tone in the vaginal wall. Therapeutically it will be possible to enhance relaxations of vaginal smooth muscle with agents that enhance NO/cGMP and/or VIP/cAMP mediated signalling.	4.5 VIP induces clitoral vasorelaxation via the cAMP pathway	[0492] The neurotransmitter and second messenger candidates responsible for increases in clitoral blood flow during sexual arousal are currently unidentified. In line with current research into vaginal blood flow, work has speculated and focused on the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP pathway. There are no reports that VIP plays a role in mediating clitoral blood flow/engorgement although VIP containing neurones have been visualised in clitoral tissue (Hauser-Kronberger et al., 1999).	[0493] In this study we demonstrate that:-	1. Infusion of VIP increases clitoral blood flow	2. The cAMP/adenylate cyclase pathway mediates VIP-induced increases in clitoral blood flow	3. VIP is an endogenous clitoral neurotransmitter that is released during sexual arousal:	1. Infusion of VIP (60-200 mu g/kg, iv bolus) induces a concentration dependant increase in clitoral blood flow (figure 5). A 115% increase in clitoral blood flow was observed after an iv infusion of 200 mu g/kg VIP. This was significantly elevated from control infusions (Hepsaline).	2. The effects of VIP on clitoral blood flow can be mimicked by an infusion of a cAMP mimetic forskolin (40nmol/kg iv bolus, Figure 5). A 156% increase in clitoral blood flow was observed after an iv infusion of 40nmol/kg forskolin. This was significantly elevated from control infusions (Hepsaline). Note the amplitude of the response is similar to that induced by VIP (200 mu g/kg, iv bolus) and comparable to those observed on vaginal blood flow in Figs 2 and 4.	3. Selective inhibitors of NEP EC 3.4.24.11 at clinically relevant doses significantly enhance pelvic nerve stimulated increases in clitoral blood flow (See Figure 12). A NEP inhibitor enhanced the peak increase in clitoral blood flow by up to 131% compared to vehicle control increases.	[0494] These data establish that VIP is capable of increasing clitoral blood flow/vasorelaxation and that this can be mimicked by activation of the cAMP/adenylate cyclase pathway. The finding that an inhibitor of NEP EC3.4.24.11 (responsible for VIP metabolism) enhances pelvic nerve stimulated increase in clitoral blood flow demonstrates that VIP is a neurotransmitter that is released during pelvic nerve stimulation/sexual arousal.	4.6 Genital blood flow is enhanced by pharmacological agents that directly or indirectly elevate cAMP levels	[0495] FSAD is associated with and may result from reduced genital blood flow. Potential approaches to treat this disorder revolve around enhancing genital blood flow. Having established that cAMP is the mediator of genital vasorelaxation and that elevations of cAMP result from neuronally released VIP, we believe that if cAMP signalling is enhanced, then as a consequence genital blood flow will be increased, hence restoring genital blood flow to normal levels and treating FSAD.	[0496] In a highly preferred aspect, we chose three targets to directly or indirectly enhance cAMP-mediated vasorelaxation - PDEcAMP inhibitors, eg PDEcAMP type 2 inhibitors, NEP (EC 3.4.24.11) inhibitors and neuropeptide Y Y1 (NPY Y1) receptor antagonists.	4.6.1 Neutral Endopeptidase (NEP EC 3.4.24.11) inhibitors	[0497] NEP EC 3.4.24.11 metabolises VIP and hence terminates VIP-mediated biological activity. NEP inhibitors will potentiate the endogenous vasorelaxant effect of VIP released during arousal. This will have the clinical effect of enhancing genital engorgement.	[0498] There have been no previous literature reports of NEP EC3.4.24.11 localisation or of it's functional role in vaginal tissue or a role in sexual arousal.	[0499] Selective inhibitors of NEP EC 3.4.24.11 at clinically relevant doses significantly enhance pelvic nerve stimulated increases in vaginal blood flow (See Figure 6).	[0500] A NEP inhibitor enhanced the peak increase in vaginal blood flow by up to 53% compared to time matched control increases. This enhancement of submaximal stimulation frequencies (eg 4Hz), was dose dependant eg 0.1mg/kg iv induced a 35.0+/-7.6% increase; 0.3mg/kg iv induced a 42.6.0+/-27.7% increase and 1.0mg/kg iv induced a 52.8+/-32.5% increase. NEP inhibitors had no effect on basal (unstimulated) vaginal blood flow. Hence, the agents of the present invention enhance arousal, by potentiating cAMP signalling, rather than induce arousal in the absence of sexual desire ie by direct increasing cAMP signalling.	[0501] Selective inhibitors of NEP EC 3.4.24.11 at clinically relevant doses significantly enhance pelvic nerve stimulated increases in clitoral blood flow (See Figure 12). A NEP inhibitor enhanced the peak increase in clitoral blood flow by up to 131% compared to vehicle control increases. NEP inhibitors had no effect on basal (unstimulated) vaginal blood flow. This further supports our believe that the agents of the present invention will enhance arousal, by potentiating cAMP signalling, rather than induce arousal in the absence of sexual desire i.e. by direct increasing cAMP signalling.	[0502] Selective inhibitors of NEP EC 3.4.24.11, at clinically relevant doses, enhance VIP-induced increases in vaginal blood flow when compared to time-matched controls. At submaximal doses of VIP (eg. 6.0 mu g/kg) a significant potentiation in both the peak increase (95+/-6%) and prolongation of the duration of the enhancement (circa 140% - from 7 to in excess of 17 minutes; See Figure 7). NEP inhibitors significantly prolong the duration of VIP-induced elevation of vaginal blood flow when given in combination with dose of VIP that produce maximal flow increases (circa 80% increase in duration - 11 to 20 minutes).	[0503] NEP inhibitors at clinically relevant doses significantly enhance VIP-induced and nerve-mediated relaxations in isolated tissue. The EC50 for VIP is significantly reduced from 18.8+/-0.6nM to 2.9+/-0.3nM in the presence of a selective NEP inhibitor (1 mu M). The effect of the NEP inhibitor is concentration dependent.	[0504] NEP EC 3.4.24.11 mRNA message and protein is expressed and has been identified in human and rabbit vagina by Northern and Western analyses.	4.6.2 Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors	[0505] cAMP is degraded by cAMP-hydrolysing PDEs ie. PDEcAMP. PDEcAMP inhibitors will potentiate the endogenous vasorelaxant effect of cAMP released during arousal. This should have the clinical effect of enhancing vaginal engorgement.	[0506] There are no literature reports of PDEcAMP localisation or of a functional role of these isozymes in vaginal tissue or a role in sexual arousal. We have shown by PDE profiling of human and rabbit vagina that the following PDEcAMP 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 & 8 isozymes are present. Inhibitors of these PDEcAMP represent potential agents to enhance vaginal blood flow and/or relax vaginal smooth muscle.	[0507] A selective inhibitor of PDEcAMP type 2 inhibitor at clinically relevant doses significantly enhances pelvic nerve stimulated increases in vaginal blood flow (See Figure 8). A PDEcAMP type 2 inhibitor (500 mu g/kg; iv) enhanced the peak increase in vaginal blood flow by 86.8+/-21.9% compared to increases observed during time matched control (@4Hz).	[0508] A selective PDEcAMP type 2 inhibitor significantly enhanced the duration of VIP (60 mu g/kg)-induced increases in peak vaginal blood flow by over 100% (measured at 50% amplitude; See Figure 9). The selective PDEcAMP type 2 inhibitor significantly enhances the peak increase in blood flow induced by VIP-stimulation (circa 15+/-3% [200 mu g/kg]).	[0509] significantly enhanced the duration of VIP-induced increases in peak vaginal blood flow by over 100% (measured at 50% amplitude; See Figure 8). The selective PDEcAMP type 2 inhibitor significantly enhances the peak increase in blood flow induced by pelvic nerve stimulation (circa 15+/-3% [200 mu g/kg] at 4Hz).	[0510] PDEcAMP inhibitors enhance VIP-induced relaxations of precontracted isolated vaginal smooth muscle (1 mu M phenylephrine; See Table 1). Selective inhibitors of PDEcAMP types 1, 2, 3 and 4 all significantly potentiated VIP-mediated relaxations. (210% @ 76nM, 130% @ 8nM, 220% @ 3.4 mu M and 160% @ 686nM potentiation of VIP EC50 values) These inhibitors were administered at dose known to be selective for the particular PDEcAMP of interest. A selective inhibitor of PDEcGMP type 5 or vehicle control had no viable effect on VIP-mediated relaxations.	4.6.3 NPY Y1 receptor antagonists	[0511] NPY exerts an inhibitory influence over VIP-mediated vasorelaxation and NPY Y1 receptor antagonists will facilitate the vasorelaxant effect of endogenous VIP released during arousal. This will have the clinical effect of enhancing vaginal engorgement.	[0512] There are no literature reports of NPY receptor localisation or of a functional role for these receptors in vaginal tissue or a role in sexual arousal.	[0513] NPY receptor expression studies have identified by Northern and Western analyses that NPY Y1 Y2 and Y5 receptor subtypes are present in human and rabbit vagina.	[0514] Selective inhibitors of NPY Y1 at clinically relevant doses significantly enhance pelvic nerve stimulated increases in vaginal blood flow (See Figure 10). An NPY Y1 antagonist enhanced the peak increase in vaginal blood flow by up to 92% compared to time matched control increases. This enhancement of submaximal stimulation frequencies (eg 4Hz), was dose dependant eg 0.01mg/kg iv induced a 15.8+/-19.6% increase; 0.03mg/kg iv induced a 35.1+/-17.17% increase; 0.10mg/kg iv induced a 60.1+/-16.9% increase and 0.3mg/kg iv induced a 91.9+/-27.4% increase (mean+/-sem n=3). NPY Y1 antagonists had no effect on basal (unstimulated) vaginal blood flow. This reinforces our view that they will enhance arousal, by potentiating cAMP signalling, rather than induce arousal in the absence of sexual desire ie by direct increasing cAMP signalling.	4.7 Effects of agents that enhance cAMP or increase vaginal blood flow on the mean arterial blood pressure in the anaesthetised rabbit	[0515] In the search for an oral therapy for FSAD it is desirable that there are no associated adverse cardiovascular effects eg effect on blood pressure or heart rate. In our studies, we have found that infusions of VIP significantly reduce mean arterial blood pressure (See Figure 3) and significantly increased heart rate. Hence, in a highly preferred aspect, the agent is not VIP. Pelvic nerve stimulation and inhibitors of PDEcAMP and NEP however had no effect on blood pressure. At 6.0 mu g/kg VIP (iv), caused a significant reduction in mean arterial blood pressure of 13.2+/-0.7mm Hg and a significant increase in heart rate of 16+/-4 beats per minute. At higher doses such as 60.0 mu g/kg VIP (iv) caused significant reduction in mean arterial blood pressure of 14.7+/-1.37mm Hg and this was associated with a significant increase in heart rate of 111+/-30 beats per minute which then increased mean arterial blood pressure by 8.5+/-1.4mm Hg.

EP1481667_0021	[0522] Compound of Formula VI ("FVI") - viz cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, 3-[[[1-(2-carboxy-4-pentenyl)cyclopentyl]carbonyl]amino]-. FVI may be prepared according to the teachings of EP-A-0274234 (Example 379 thereof).	[0523] In particular, Fla, FII, FIII and FIV are PDEcAMP inhibitors. Fla is a I:PDEI, FII is a I:PDEII, FIII is a I:PDEIII and FIV is a I:PDEIV.	[0524] The data for these compounds are presented above in the previous Example sections - for example see Table I.	[0525] As is evident, these PDEcAMP inhibitors enhance VIP-induced relaxations of isolated tissue.	[0526] FII - which is a selective I:PDEII - enhances VIP-induced increases in vaginal blood flow at clinically relevant doses.	[0527] FII also enhances pelvic nerve stimulated increases in vaginal blood flow at clinically relevant doses.	[0528] FV and FVI are selective inhibitors of NEP EC 3.4.24.11.	[0529] The data presented above in the previous Example sections are for FVI. However, similar results were obtained for FV.	[0530] As is evident, FV and FVI enhance VIP-induced increases in vaginal blood flow at clinically relevant doses.	[0531] FV and FVI also enhance pelvic nerve stimulated increases in vaginal blood flow at clinically relevant doses.

CONCLUSIONS	[0598] We have developed an animal model that reflects the physiological arousal response observed during female sexual arousal and directly reflects the clinical data obtained in human volunteers. The model uses Laser Doppler technologies to record small changes in vaginal and clitoral blood flow induced by pelvic nerve stimulation or vasoactive neurotransmitters. During sexual arousal, there is an increase in genital blood flow resulting from increased innervation from the pelvic nerve. The pelvic nerve-stimulated increase in vaginal and clitoral blood flow, observed in the animal model, represents the endogenous vascular effects observed during female sexual arousal - i.e. engorgement. Therefore this model can be used to firstly, identify the mechanisms involved in the regulation of vaginal and clitoral blood flow and secondly, to validate novel approaches for the enhancement of genital blood flow.	[0599] This study has successfully used a combination of in vivo, in vitro and biochemical techniques to show that VIP mediates genital blood flow and to identify cAMP as the mediator/second messenger regulating genital vasorelaxation (and vaginal wall relaxation). Using this animal model we have demonstrated that infusion fusion of VIP induces increases in vaginal and clitoral blood flow. Using an inhibitor of VIP metabolism (e.g. a NEP EC3.4.24.11 inhibitor), we have also demonstrated that the increases in genital blood flow observed during pelvic nerve stimulation (ie sexual arousal) is mediated by VIP. We have shown that VIP-mediated increases in genital blood flow result from elevation of tissue cAMP, whereas previously VIP had been shown to increase vaginal blood flow in healthy volunteers but the cellular mechanism was not identified. Additionally, we have demonstrated that genital blood flow can be enhanced directly with a cAMPmimetic or indirectly by elevating cAMP concentrations with a PDEcAMP type 2 inhibitor or an NPY Y1 receptor antagonist.	[0600] The major cause of FSAD is decreased genital blood flow and this manifests itself as reduced vaginal, labial and clitoral engorgement. Treatment of women with FSAD is achievable by restoration of the normal sexual arousal response. This can be achieved by enhancing genital blood flow. Our approach for the treatment of FSAD will be to enhance genital blood flow thereby potentiating vaginal engorgement/lubrication and clitoral engorgement/sensitivity by either directly or indirectly potentiating endogenous cAMP signalling eg with an inhibitor of NEP (EC 3.4.24.11), a cAMP-hydrolysing PDE inhibitor or a NPY receptor antagonist. This will have the overall effect of restoring or potentiating the normal arousal response with no cardiovascular side effects. Sexual arousal/engorgement will be enhanced, rather than simply being induced in the absence of sexual drive, which may be the case with some exogenously administered vasoactive agents eg VIP.

[0002] Pursuant to 35 USC §119, this application claims the benefit of Swedish Patent Application No. 0104366-0 filed Dec. 20, 2001.	TECHNICAL FIELD	[0003] The present invention relates to novel compounds which are pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, and which modulate the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) α and/or γ. The said compounds are predicted to be useful in the treatment of metabolic diseases, e.g. type II diabetes.	BACKGROUND	[0004] In developed societies, chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis and cancer are responsible for most deaths. These ailments have complex causes involving genetic, environmental and nutritional factors. There is evidence that a group of closely related nuclear receptors, called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), may be involved in these diseases. This, together with the fact that drugs such as thiazolidinediones and fibrates can modulate PPAR activity, has instigated a huge research effort into PPARs. For reviews on PPARs and their medical significance, see e.g. Kersten, S. et al. (2000) Nature 405:421-424; Willson, T. M. et al. (2000) J. Med. Chem. 43:527-550; Vamecq, J. et al. (1999) Lancet 354:141-148.	[0005] The PPARs were first cloned as the nuclear receptors that mediate the effects of synthetic compounds called peroxisome proliferators on gene transcription. It soon became clear that eicosanoids and fatty acids could also regulate gene transcription through PPARs. At the molecular level, PPARs act in a similar manner to other nuclear hormone receptors. First, they bind a specific element in the promoter region of target genes. PPAR and some other nuclear hormone receptors bind the promoter only as a heterodimer with the receptor for 9-cis retinoic acid, RXR (retinoid X receptor). Second, they activate transcription in response to binding of the hormone (ligand). For the PPAR:RXR heterodimer, binding of the ligand of either receptor can activate the complex, but binding of both ligands simultaneously is more potent.	[0006] Three PPAR isotypes have been identified: α, β (also called δ and NUCI) and γ. PPARα (GenBank Accession No. NM—005036) is expressed most in brown adipose tissue and liver, then kidney, heart and skeletal muscle. PPARγ (GenBank Accession No. NM—005037) is mainly expressed in adipose tissue, and to a lesser extent in colon, the immune system and the retina. PPARβ is found in many tissues but the highest expression is in the gut, kidney and heart.	[0007] PPARs are ligand-dependent transcription factors: activation of target gene transcription depends on the binding of the ligand to the receptor. Some ligands are shared by the three isotypes, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids and probably oxidized fatty acids.	[0008] There are two varieties of diabetes. Type I is insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), for which insulin injection is required; it was formerly referred to as juvenile onset diabetes. In this type, insulin is not secreted by the pancreas and hence must be taken by injection. Type II, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) may be controlled by dietary restriction. It derives from insufficient pancreatic insulin secretion and tissue resistance to secreted insulin, which is complicated by subtle changes in the secretion of insulin by the beta cells. Despite their former classifications as juvenile or adult, either type can occur at any age; NIDDM, however, is the most common type, accounting for 90 percent of all diabetes.	[0009] While the exact causes of diabetes remain obscure, it is evident that NIDDM is linked to heredity and obesity. NIDDM is almost invariably accompanied by dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated triglycerides (TGs), VLDL-C and increased small dense LDL-C in combination with decreased levels of HDL-C and prolonged post-prandial hyperlipidemia. This form of dyslipidemia is highly atherogenic and thus represents a major risk factor for the development of premature atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD), which is the major cause of mortality in diabetic patients. A direct correlation between low HDL levels and incidence of CAD has been identified. In addition, this pathological lipid profile or “lipotoxicity” is suggested to contribute to β-cell failure and as a consequence impaired glucose stimulated insulin release.	[0010] Pharmacological, genetic and biochemical studies have unequivocally established that PPARα and PPARγ are key sensors and transcriptional modulators of lipid and glucose homeostasis, respectively. Accordingly, a selective “dual action drug” that selectively binds and activates PPARα and γ is hypothesized to mechanistically target the two major metabolic abnormalities observed in type II diabetic patients and thus therapeutically intervene with insulin resistance, CAD and possibly also impaired insulin secretion or β-cell failure.	[0011] Murakami et al. (1998) Diabetes 47: 1841-1847, discloses a thiazolidinedione derivative which activated both PPARα and PPARγ, and restored reduced lipid oxidation, when administered to obese rats. It was suggested that PPARα agonism has a protective effect against abnormal lipid metabolism in liver of obese rats. Agents modulating both PPARα and PPARγ are also disclosed in Shibata, T. et al. (1999) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 364: 211-219; and in WO 99/19313.

[0013] The compound 5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile, was used by Chern et al. (1996) Chin. Pharm. J. 48: 37-52 for the synthetic preparation of pyrazolo-pyrimidinyl-oxadiazole derivatives as potential 5-HT3 antagonists. Siddiqi et al. (1996) Nucleosides Nucleotides 15(1-3), 693-717 showed that 2-(methylthio)-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile and acts as an adenosine receptor ligand.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION	[0180] Definitions	[0181] The term “C1-6 alkyl” denotes a straight or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of said C1-6 alkyl include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl and straight- and branched-chain pentyl and hexyl. Derived expressions such as “C1-6 alkoxy”, “C1-6 alkylthio” and “C1-6 alkylamino” are to be construed accordingly where an oxy group, thio group or an amino group, respectively, is bridging the C1-6 alkyl group to the node at which that substituent is substituted.	[0182] The term “C1-6 acyl” as used herein refers to the radical obtained by removal of hydroxyl from the carboxyl group in the corresponding carboxylic acid containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of said C1-6 acyl include formyl, acetyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, and valeryl.	[0183] The term “halogen” shall mean fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.	[0184] The term “aryl” denotes aromatic rings (monocyclic or bicyclic) having from 6 to 10 ring carbon atoms. Examples of said aryl include phenyl, indenyl and naphthyl.	[0185] The term “heteroaryl” denotes a mono- or bicyclic ring system (only one ring need to be aromatic, and substitution may be in any ring) having from 5 to 10 ring atoms, in which one or more of the ring atoms are other than carbon, such as nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. Examples of said heteroaryl include pyrrole, thiazole, imidazole, thiophene, furan, isothiazole, thiadiazole, oxazole, isoxazole, oxadiazole, pyridine, pyrazine, pyrimidine, pyridazine, pyrazole, triazole, tetrazole, chroman, isochroman, quinoline, quinoxaline, isoquinoline, phthalazine, quinazoline, indole, isoindole, isoindoline, indoline, benzothiophene, benzofuran, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, isobenzofuran, benzoxazole, 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole, benzothiazole, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole, benzimidazole, indazole, 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxine, indane, 1,3-benzodioxole, 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine, 1,5-naphthyridine, 1,8-naphthyridine.	[0186] The term “heteroalkyl chain” denotes a straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated, chain comprising from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, N, and S. The heteroatom(s) may be placed at any position of the heteroalkyl group.	[0187] Depending on the process conditions the end products of the Formula I are obtained either in neutral or salt form. Both the free base and the salts of these end products are within the scope of the invention.	[0188] All diastereomeric forms possible (pure enantiomers, tautomers, racemic mixtures and unequal mixtures of two enantiomers) are within the scope of the invention. Such compounds can also occur as cis- or trans-, E- or Z-double bond isomer forms. All isomeric forms are contemplated.	[0189] The compounds of the formula I may be used as such or, where appropriate, as pharmacologically acceptable salts (acid or base addition salts) thereof.	[0190] The pharmacologically acceptable addition salts as mentioned above are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid and base addition salt forms which the compounds are able to form. Compounds which have basic properties can be converted to their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts by treating the base form with an appropriate acid. Exemplary acids include inorganic acids, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen iodide, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid; and organic acids such as acetic acid, propanoic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, glycolic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, oxalic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, pamoic acid, benzoic acid, ascorbic acid and the like. Exemplary base addition salt forms are the sodium, potassium, calcium salts, and salts with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as, for example, ammonia, alkylamines, benzathine, and amino acids, such as, e.g. arginine and lysine. The term addition salt as used herein also comprises solvates which the compounds and salts thereof are able to form, such as, for example, hydrates, alcoholates and the like.	[0191] Therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of mammals, including man, for conditions where modulation of either PPARα or PPARγ activity, or the combination of both PPARα and PPARγ activities, is of therapeutic benefit. Such conditions could be e.g. diabetes, diabetes mellitus type 2, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and/or in combinations with dyslipidemias, obesity, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, PCOS, gestational diabetes, inflammation.	[0192] The compounds according to the invention are particularly useful for the treatment of type II diabetes, in combination(s) with dyslipidemias, obesity, atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. For this purpose the compounds according to the invention can be used alone or in combination(s) with sulfonylureas, metformin, alpha-glycosidase inhibitors, insulin or other anti-diabetic treatments/agents. Reference to treatment is intended to include prophylaxis as well as the alleviation of established symptoms.	[0193] For clinical use, the compounds of the invention are formulated into pharmaceutical formulations for oral, rectal, parenteral or other mode of administration. Pharmaceutical formulations are usually prepared by mixing the active substance, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with conventional pharmaceutical excipients. The formulations can be further prepared by known methods such as granulation, compression, microencapsulation, spray coating, etc.	
US20030134862_0006	[0194] The formulations may be prepared by conventional methods in the dosage form of tablets, capsules, granules, powders, syrups, suspensions, suppositories or injections. Liquid formulations may be prepared by dissolving or suspending the active substance in water or other suitable vehicles. Tablets and granules may be coated in a conventional manner.	[0195] “An effective amount” refers to an amount of a compound which confers a therapeutic effect on the treated subject. The therapeutic effect may be objective (i.e., measurable by some test or marker) or subjective (i.e., subject gives an indication of or feels an effect). The dosage may, for example, range from about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg per kilo of body weight, preferably from about 0.5 mg to about 500 mg per kilo of body weight, administered singly or multiply in doses. The typical daily dose of the active substance varies within a wide range and will depend on various factors such as for example the individual requirement of each patient and the route of administration.	[0196] The compounds according to the invention may also be administered as prodrugs that may be converted to the active ingredient in question after metabolic transformation in vivo. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in “Design of Prodrugs” ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.

Reporter gene assays were performed essentially as described in Bertilsson et al., 1998 (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 95:12208-12213), by transient co-transfections of CaCo2/TC cells with a GAL-4-LBD (Ligand Binding Domain) fusion constructs, containing the nucleotide sequence corresponding to human PPARαLBD (i.e. amino acid residues 167-468) or human PPARγLBD (i.e. amino acid residues 204-477), together with a 4×UAS-luciferase reporter gene construct, using the FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturers recommendations. After 24 hours, the cells were treated with trypsin, transferred to 96-well microplates and allowed to settle. Induction was performed for 24 hours by applying different concentrations of compounds diluted in DMSO or DMSO alone (vehicle). Subsequently, the cells were lysed and luciferase activity measured, according to standard procedures. Experiments were performed in quadruplicate on at least three occasions.

Competitive ligand binding assays were performed on immobilized GST-PPARαLBD or GST-PPARγLBD fusion proteins from crude extracts incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following immobilization, the slurry was washed three times in binding buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton-X100, 10 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, dispensed in 96-well filter plates (MHVB N45, Millipore) and incubated with a fixed amount tritiated ligand and different concentrations of cold competing ligands. Equilibrium binding was reached after incubation for 2 hours at room temperature on a plate shaker. The plates were then washed 3 times in binding buffer, dried overnight at room temperature followed by scintillation counting after the addition of 25 μl of scintillant (Optiscint Hisafe, Wallac) per well. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated independently at least three times. 3H-BRL49653 (ART-605; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, USA) was used as the tracer in PPARγ competitive ligand binding experiments at a concentration of 30 nM (10). 3H-GW2331 (70 nM) was synthesized at Pharmacia Corporation and used as the tracer in PPARα competitive ligand binding experiments (Kliewer, S.

The disorders that can be treating by the invention include hearing loss, vision loss, neurodegeneration caused by epileptic seizures, neurotoxin poisoning, Restless Leg Syndrome, multi-system atrophy, non-vascular headache, and depression.	[0001] This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/237,770, filed Oct. 2, 2000.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION	[0002] This invention relates to the treatment of neurological disorders. This invention also relates to the treatment of depression. More particularly, this invention relates to treatment of hearing loss, vision loss, neurodegeneration caused by epileptic seizures, neurotoxin poisoning, Restless Leg Syndrome, multi-system atrophy, non-vascular headache, and depression comprising administering an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) NR2B subtype receptor antagonist.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	[0003] NMDA Receptors and NMDA Receptor Subunits	[0004] Glutamate and aspartate play dual roles in the central nervous system as essential amino acids and as the principal excitatory neurotransmitters (hereinafter referred to as excitatory amino acids or EAAs). There are at least four classes of EAA receptors: NMDA, AMPA (2-amino-3-(methyl-3-hydroxyisoxazol4-yl)propanoic acid), kainate and metabotropic receptors. These EAA receptors mediate a wide range of signaling events that impact all physiological brain functions. For example, it has been reported that NMDA receptor antagonists produce an analgesic effect under certain conditions (Wong, C. S., Cherng, C. H. and Ho, S. T., Clinical Applications of Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists in Pain Management Acta Anaesthesiologica.Sinica; 33, 227-232 (1995)).	[0005] The NMDA receptor is an ion channel permeable to Na+ and Ca2+. The receptor is gated by synaptically released glutamate in the presence of co-agonist glycine and concomitant-depolarization (Mayer, M. L. and Westbrook, G. L., The Physiology of Excitatory Amino Acids in the Vertebrate Nervous System, Progress in Neurobiology, 28, 197-276 (1987)). Thus, NMDA receptor activity may be attenuated by blockade, for example, of 1) the glutamate binding site, 2) the glycine co-agonist binding site, or 3) the site of the ion channel.	[0006] The NMDA receptor is composed of multiple protein subunits (Seeburg, P. H., The Molecular Biology of Mammalian Glutamate Receptor Channels, Trends in Neurosci., 16, 359-365 (1993)). The protein subunits fall into two categories: NR2 and NR1. The NR2 subunits contain glutamate binding sites, whereas the NR1 subunits contain the glycine binding sites. Five subunits have been cloned to date, namely NR1 and NR2A, NR2B, NR2C and NR2D. Expression studies indicate the functional receptor is composed of at least one NR1 site and one or more of the NR2 sites. Thus, different subtypes of NMDA receptors can be categorized based on their particular NR2 subunit composition. For example, in the adult mammalian brain, the NR1 and NR2A subunits are widely expressed, forming a subtype of NMDA receptor comprising an NR2A subunit. In contrast, NR2B subunit expression is mostly localized in forebrain regions including cortex, hippocampus and striatum; the NR2C subunit is expressed in the cerebellum; and the NR2D subunit is restricted to the midbrain region. NIMDA receptor subtypes of corresponding composition can accordingly respectively be found in forebrain, cerebellum, and midbrain.	[0007] Compounds that inhibit NMDA receptor activity by interacting at the glutamate, glycine, or receptor-associated ion channel as described above have little (<10 fold) selectivity across the different NMDA receptor subtypes. That is, such compounds inhibit NMDA receptors with potencies within a 10-fold range regardless of the subunit combination. However, the subunit composition of the NMDA receptor can confer unique physiology with regard to conductance, kinetics, and affinity for certain agonists. For example, the subunit composition of an NMDA receptor has significant effects on its sensitivity to a group of allosteric modulators which include protons, polyamines, Zn2+, and oxidizing/reducing agents (Chenard, B. L. and Menniti, F. S., Antagonists Selective for NMDA Receptors Containing the NR2B Subunit, Current Pharmaceutical Design, 1999, 5:381 404)). Receptors comprising the NR2B subunit possess a unique site to which compounds may bind, resulting in specific inhibition this subtype of NMDA receptor as compared to NMDA receptors that do not comprise an NR2B subunit (Ibid). This unique site is distinct from the glutamate binding site on the NR2B subunit.	[0008] Antagonizing NMDA receptors at the NR2B subunit specific binding site can be used to substantially avoid side effects that have been noted at therapeutic drug levels with other non-specific NMDA receptor antagonists. Both glutamate competitive antagonists and channel blocking agents cause cardiovascular effects and psychotic symptoms in man (Chenard and Menniti, supra). In rodents, these types of compounds also cause locomotor hyperactivity and a paradoxical neuronal hyperexcitability manifest as neuronal vacuolization in cingulate and retrosplenial cortices (Id.). Antagonists at the glycine co-agonist site cause less locomoter activation and do not cause neuronal vacuolization at neuroprotective doses in rodents, however physicochemical problems (for example, problems relating to solubility, brain penetration and protein binding) associated with the quinoxalinedione nucleus typical of such compounds have hindered efforts to bring this class of molecules forward in the clinic (Id). NMDA receptor antagonists selective for the NR2B subunit offer a means of inhibition without the side effects and psychochemical difficulties described above.	[0009] NR2B Subunit Selective NMDA Receptor Antagonists	[0010] Compounds that inhibit NMDA receptors comprising an NR2B subunit by specific binding to the NR2B subunit have been demonstrated by measurement of inhibition of NMDA-induced current in Xenopus Oocytes cotransfected with the genes expressing the NR1 and NR2B subunits (Chenard and Menniti, supra). Specificity for NR2B can be confirmed by observing reduced inhibition of the NMDA-induced current in Xenopus Oocytes cotransfected with an NR1 subunit and an NR2 subunit other than NR2B.	[0011] A number of compounds have been found to act as antagonists that target the NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors that contain them. The first compound identified to display significant affinity for the NR2B subunit was ifenprodil. Ifenprodil is both more potent and efficacious for blockade of ion current through NMDA receptors comprised of NR1/NR2B subunits compared to NR1/NR2A, NR2C, or NR2D subunits.	[0012] For example, ifenprodil and related compounds have been demonstrated in animal models of pain perception to produce significant analgesic activity (Bernardi, M., Bertolini, A., Szczawinska, K. And Genedani, S., Blockade of the Polyamine Site of NMDA Receptors Produces Antinociception and Enhances the Effect of Morphine, in Mice, European Journal of Pharmacology, 298, 51-55, (1996); Taniguchi, K., Shinjo, K., Mizutani, M., Shimada, K., Ishikawa, T., Menniti, F. S. and Nagahisa, A, Antinociceptive Activity of CP-101,606, an NMDA Receptor NR2B Subunit Antagonist, British Journal of Pharmacology, 122, 809-812,(1997)).	[0013] U.S. Pat. No. 5,710,168 (issued Jan. 20, 1998) claims the use of certain compounds of formula I, infra, having NR2B subunit selectivity for treating a disease or condition which is susceptible to treatment by blocking of NMDA receptor sites, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord trauma, pain, psychotic conditions, drug addiction, migraine, hypoglycemia, anxiolytic conditions, urinary incontinence, and ischemic events arising from CNS surgery, open heart surgery or any procedure during which the function of the cardiovascular system is compromised.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION	[0040] “Mammal” as used herein refers to any mammal, including humans.	[0041] The phrase “sensorineural hearing loss” refers to hearing loss caused by loss of neurons. Such hearing loss can be, for example, genetic in origin. Another example of sensorineural hearing loss is antibiotic-induced, such as aminoglycoside-induced, hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss can also be induced by excessive sound.	[0042] “Neurotoxin poisoning” refers to poisoning caused by a neurotoxin. A neurotoxin is any chemical or substance that can cause neural death and thus neurological damage. An example of a neurotoxin is alcohol, which, when abused by a pregnant female, can result in alcohol poisoning and neurological damage known as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in a newbom. Other examples of neurotoxins include, but are not limited to, kainic acid, domoic acid, and acromelic acid; certain pesticides, such as DDT; certain insecticides, such as organophosphates; volatile organic solvents such as hexacarbons (e.g. toluene); heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury, arsenic, and phosphorous); aluminum; certain chemicals used as weapons, such as Agent Orange and Nerve Gas; and neurotoxic antineoplastic agents.	[0043] “Neurodegeneration of the visual pathway” refers to neural cell death occurring in neurons involved in vision, for example neurons in the occipital lobe, optic nerve, and retina. Neurodegeneration of the visual pathway can be caused, for example, by a stroke in the visual pathway, for example a retinal stroke. Stoke can also occur in the optic nerve or the occipital lobe. Neurodegeneration of the visual pathway can also be caused by neurodegenerative diseases, for example macular degeneration. Neurodegeneratior of the visual pathway can also be caused by diseases that are not necessarily considered neurodegenerative, such as glaucoma, which can cause retinal degeneration.	[0044] “Non-vascular headache” generally refers to headaches other than migraines. Examples of non-vascular headaches include, but are not limited to, stress headaches and sinus headaches.	[0045] The phrase “neurological damage” refers herein to neuron cell death.	[0046] The terms “treatment”, “treating”, and the like, refer to reversing, alleviating, or inhibiting the progress of the disease or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disease or condition. As used herein, these terms also encompass, depending on the condition of the patient, preventing the onset of a disease or condition, or of symptoms associated with a disease orcondition. Such prevention also includes reducing the severity of a disease or condition or symptoms associated therewith prior to affliction with said disease or condition. Thus, “treatment” encompasses administration of the antagonist to a subject that is not at the time of administration afflicted with the disease or condition, and “treatment” can include preventing the recurrence of a disease or condition or of symptoms associated therewith.

[0064] The compounds of formula I can be prepared as follows. The compounds of formula I wherein R2 and R5 are taken together forming a chroman-4-ol ring, and R1, R3, and R4 are hydrogen, can be prepared by one or more of the synthetic methods described and referred to in U.S. Pat. No. 5,356,905 (incorporated herein by reference, supra). The compounds of formula I wherein R2 and R5 are taken separately, and R1, R2, R3 and R4 are hydrogen can be prepared by one or more of the synthetic methods described and referred to in U.S. Pat.

The compounds of formula I can also be prepared by one or more of the synthetic methods described and referred to in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/292,651; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,744,483 (issued Apr. 28, 1998) and 6,008,233 (issued Dec. 28, 1999); PCT International Application No. PCT/IB95/00398 which designates the U.S. (filed May 26, 1995) (corresponding to WO 96/37222); and PCT International Application No. PCT/IB95/00380 which designates the U.S. (filed May 18, 1995) (corresponding to WO 96/06081). These United States Patents and PCT International Applications, and the United States patent application, are also all incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.	[0065] A preferred compound, (1S,2S)-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidin-1-yl)-1-propanol ((1S,2S) free base), and its tartrate salt, can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,160, referred to above. The resolution of racemic 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidin-1-yl)-1-propanol to form the (1S,2S) free base and the corresponding (1R,2R) enantiomer can be carried out as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,008,233 (issued Dec. 28, 1999), referred to above, and as exemplified in Example 1 below.	[0066] The anhydrous mesylate of the (1S,2S) free base can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,160, referred to above. The anhydrous mesylate of the (1S,2S) free base, when equilibrated in an 81% relative humidity environment, will convert to the mesyiate salt trihydrate of the (1S,2S) enantiomer.	[0067] The mesylate salt trihydrate of (1S,2S)-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy4-phenylpiperidin-1-yl)-1-propanol can be prepared from the (1S,2S) free base as described in the U.S. Pat. No. 6,008,233, entitled “(1S,2S)-1-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-Hydroxy-4-Phenylpiperidin-1-yl)-1-Propanol Methanesulfonate Trihydrate”, referred to above and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In this method, (1S,2S) free base is dissolved in water at 30° C. To this solution is added at least 1 equivalent of methane sulfonic acid and the resulting mixture is warmed to 60-65° C. The warm solution can be filtered to render it particulate free. The solution is concentrated to approximately 40% of the initial volume, cooled below 10° C., isolated by filtration and dried to a water content (measured Karl Fischer titration) of approximately 11.3%. The resulting crystalline mesylate salt trihydrate can be further purified by recrystallization.	[0068] Another preferred compound, (3R,4S)-3-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-piperidin-1-yl]-chroman-4,7-diol ((3R,4S) chromanol), can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,356,905, 5,744,483 (issued Apr. 28, 1998), and United States provisional patent application entitled “Process For The Resolution Of Cis-Racemic 7-Benzyloxy-3-[4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-4-Hydroxy-Piperidin-1-yl]-Chroman-4-ol Dibenzoyl-D-Tartrate”, all three of which are referred to above. The starting materials and reagents required for the synthesis of the (3R,4S) chromanol are readily available, either commercially, according to synthetic methods disclosed in the literature, or by synthetic methods exemplified in the description provided below.	[0069] The (3R,4S) chromanol can be prepared by fractional crystallization of the L-proline ester of racemic cis-7-benzyloxy-3-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-piperidin-1-yl]-chroman-4-ol, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,483, referred to above. In a preferred method, the resolution method described in United States provisional patent application entitled “Process For The Resolution Of Cis-Racemic 7-Benzyloxy-3-[4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-4-Hydroxy-Piperidin-1-yl]-Chroman-4-ol Dibenzoyl-D-Tartrate”, referred to above; and as exemplified in Example 3. In this method, the parent chromanol is prepared by -dissolving racemic cis-7-benzyloxy-3-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-piperidin-1-yl]-chroman-4-ol with an equal -molar amount of dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid in boiling aqueous ethanol. Racemic cis-7-benzyloxy-3-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-piperidin-1-yl]-chroman-4-ol is prepared as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/189,479, referred to above. The concentration of aqueous ethanol is not critical and may be varied between 75% and 95% ethanol (ETOH). A concentration of 9:1/ETOH:H2O has been found to be effective and is preferred. A sufficient amount of the aqueous ethanol solvent to dissolve the racemic compound is required. This amount has been found to be about 17 ml per gram of racemic compound.	[0070] Upon stirring while heating under reflux, the racemic compound dissolves to form a hazy solution which is allowed to cool with stirring whereupon the (+) isomer, (3R;4S)-7-benzyloxy-3-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-piperidin-yl]-chroman-4-ol dibenzoyl-D-tartrate, precipitates and may be collected by filtration and washed with aqueous ethanol. This is the tartrate salt of the (3R,4S) chromanol. The lactate and mandelate salts of the (3R,4S) chromanol are prepared in an analogous manner. This initial product is of about 90% optical purity. If a higher purity is desired, the product may be heated again with aqueous ethanol, cooled and the product collected and washed. Two such treatments were found to yield the (+) isomer of 99.4% optical purity in an overall yield of 74%. This method avoids a reduction step with lithium aluminum hydride and is therefore preferable for bulk operations. This method also can produce a significantly higher yield of the desired product.	[0071] The above described (+) isomer can be converted to (3R,4S)-3-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-piperidin-1-yl]-chroman-4,7-diol by standard procedures. For example, treatment with dilute base can be used to free the piperidinyl base and subsequent hydrogeneration removes the 7-benzyl group to yield the (3R,4S) chromanol.	[0072] NR2B subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonists useful in the practice of the invention may also be used in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The expression “pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts” is intended to include but not be limited to such salts as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, acetate, succinate, citrate, tartrate, lactate, mandelate, methanesulfonate (mesylate) and p-toluenesulfonate (tosylate) salts. The acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention are readily prepared by reacting the base forms with the appropriate acid. When the salt is of a monobasic acid (e.g., the hydrochloride, the hydrobromide, the p-toluenesulfonate, the acetate), the hydrogen form of a dibasic acid. (e.g., the hydrogen sulfate, the succinate) or the dihydrogen form of a tribasic acid (e.g., the dihydrogen phosphate, the citrate), at least one molar equivalent and usually a molar excess of the acid is employed. However when such salts as the sulfate, the hemisuccinate, the hydrogen phosphate or the phosphate are desired, the appropriate and exact chemical equivalents of acid will generally be used. The free base and the acid are usually combined in a co-solvent from which the desired salt precipitates, or can be otherwise isolated by concentration and/or addition of a non-solvent.	[0073] Any other compound that is an NR2B subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonist, including its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, can be used in the methods of this invention. NMDA receptor antagonists having NR2B subunit selectivity that may be used according to the present invention are, for example, described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,046,213; 5,185,343; 5,272,160, 5,338,754; and 5,356,905 (which issued, respectively, on Apr. 4, 2000; Feb. 9, 1993; Dec. 21, 1993; Aug. 16, 1994; and Oct. 18, 1994); U.S. Pat. No. 6,046,213 (issued Apr. 4, 2000), U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,483 (issued Apr. 28, 1998) and 6,008,233 (issued Dec. 28, 1999); PCT International Application No. PCT/IB95/00398 (filed May 26, 1995, corresponding to WO 96/37222); and PCT International Application No. PCT/IB95/00380 (filed May 18, 1995, corresponding to WO 96/06081). Other NR2B subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonists that may be used according to the present invention are described in WO 97/32581 (International Publication Date Sep. 12, 1997), WO 98/18793 (International Publication Date May 7, 1998), WO 97/23202. (International Publication Date Jul. 3, 1997), EP 0 824 098 A1 (Date of Publication, Feb. 18, 1998), EP 0846 683 A1 (Date of Publication, Jun. 10, 1998), and DE 19739331 (published Nov. 26, 1998). All of the foregoing patents and published patent applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.	[0074] Other compounds that are indicated to bind selectively to NR2B NMDA receptor subunits that may be used according to the present invention are ifenprodil, supra, eliprodil (described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,690,931 (issued Sep. 1, 1987); and compounds described in WO 97/23458 (International Publication Date Jul. 3, 1997), WO 97/23216 (International Publication Date Jul. 3, 1997); WO 97/23215 (International Publication Date Jul. 3, 1997); and WO 97/23214 (International Publication Date Jul. 3, 1997). The preceding U.S. Patent and PCT International Applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.	[0075] Compounds that selectively antagonize NMDA receptors comprising an NR2B subunit by specifically binding to the NR2B subunit can be determined by screening compounds for inhibition of NMDA-induced current in recombinant Xenopus Oocytes cotransfected with the NR1A subunit and the NR2B subunit (see, e.g., Monyer, et al., Science, 1992, 256:1217-1221). A compound's activity in inhibiting current in the recombinant cells comprising the NR2B subunit can be compared to its activity inhibiting NMDA-induced current in recombinant Xenopus Oocytes expressing the NR1 subunit and NR2A, NR2C, and NR2D subunits. (See, Chenard and Menniti, supra).	[0076] One general method that can also generally predict whether or not a compound has NR2B subunit selectivity, for purposes of the present invention, is a standard competitive binding assay using [3H] radiolabeled racemic CP-101,606 (which contains [3H] (+)-(1S, 2S)-1-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidino)-1-propanol; see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,046,213). If a compound has an IC50 of less than about 5 μM for inhibition of racemic [3H] CP-101,606 binding to the NR2B subunit, than the compound has NR2B subunit selectivity for purposes of the present invention. An example of such an assay is as follows:	[0077] Example of NR2B subunit binding assay. Selectivity of compounds for the NR2B-subunit containing NMDA receptor can be defined as an affinity for the racemic [3H] CP-101,606 binding site in forebrain of rats, as described in Chenard and Menniti, supra. This affinity is assessed in a radioligand binding assay as described below. Selective compounds are preferably those which displace specific binding of racemic [3H]CP-101,606 from rat forebrain membranes with an IC50 of about ≦5 μM.	[0078] The binding of racemic [3H] (+)-(1S, 2S)-1-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidino)-1-propanol to rat forebrain membranes is measured as described by Menniti et al. (CP-101,606, a potent neuroprotectant selective for forebrain neurons, European Journal of Pharmacology, 1997, 331:117-126). Forebrains of adult male CD rats are homogenized in 0.32M sucrose at 4° C. The crude nuclear pellet is removed by centrifugation at 1,000×g for 10 min., and the supernatant centrifuged at 17,000×g for 25 min. The resulting pellet is resuspended in 5 mM Tris acetate pH 7.4 at 4° C. for 10 min. to lyse cellular particles and again centrifuged at 17,000×g. The resulting pellet is washed twice in Tris acetate, resuspended at 10 mg protein/ml and stored at −20° C. until use.	[0079] For binding assays, membranes are thawed, homogenized, and diluted to 0.5 mg protein/ml with 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4. Compounds under study are added at various concentrations followed by racemic [3H] CP-101,606 (specific activity 42.8 Ci/mmol, 5 nM final concentration). Following incubation for 20 min at 30° C. in a shaking water bath, samples are filtered onto Whatman GFB glass fiber filters using a MB-48R Cell Harvester (Brandel Research and Development Laboratories, Gaithersburg Md.). Filters are washed for 10 s with ice cold Tris HCl buffer and the radioactivity trapped on the filter quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Nonspecific binding is determined in parallel incubations containing 100 μM racemic CP-101,606. Specific binding is defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding.	
US20040192763_0004	[0080] In one embodiment of the present invention, an NR2B subunit selective NMDA antagonist is furthermore selective for NR2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors over α1-adrengergic receptors. For example, although ifenprodil (supra) has selectivity for the NR2B subtype of NMDA receptor, this compound is also a well known α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist. (Carter et al J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 235, 475-482 (1990)). Compounds that antagonize α1-adrengergic receptors can cause a reduction in blood pressure that can be a complication to therapeutic use. Preferably, the NMDA antagonist has a ratio of NR2B receptor activity to α1-adrenergic receptor activity of at least about 3:1, more preferably at least about 5:1.	[0081] Affinity for the NR2B subunit containing NMDA receptor is measured as the IC50 for displacement of specific binding of racemic [3H] (+)-(1S, 2S)-1-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidino)-1-propanol from rat forebrain membranes (described above). Affinity for the α1-adrengergic receptor is defined as the IC50 for displacement of specific binding of racemic [3H]prazosin from rat brain membranes, measured as described by Greengrass and Bremner (Binding Characteristics of [3H]prazosin to Rat Brainα-Adrenergic Receptors, European Journal of Pharmacology, 55, 323-326, (1979)). A compound with a ratio of ([3H]prazosin/[3H] (+)-(1S, 2S)-1-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy4-phenylpiperido)-1-propanol) affinity greater than three is considered selective.	[0082] Forebrains of adult male Sprague Dawley rats are homogenized in 20 volumes of ice cold 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.7). The homogenate is centrifuged at 56,000×g for 10 min. at 4° C. The pellet is resuspended and centrifuged under identical conditions and the final pellet is resuspended in 80 volumes of 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) at 4° C.	[0083] For binding assays, compounds under study are added at various concentrations to 500 μg membrane protein in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer, followed by [3H]prazosin (Amersham, specific activity 33 Ci/mmol, 0.2 nM final concentration). Following incubation for 30 min at 25° C. in a shaking water bath, samples are filtered onto Whatman GFB glass fiber filters using a MB-48R Cell. Harvester (Brandel Research and Development Laboratories, Gaithersburg Md.). Filters are washed three times for 10s with ice cold Tris HCl buffer and the radioactivity trapped on the filter quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Nonspecific binding is determined in parallel incubations containing 100 nM prazosin. Specific binding is defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding.	[0084] An effective amount of the NR2B subunit selective NMDA antagonist for use on the present invention is typically from about 0.02 to 250 mg/kg/day (0.001-12.5 g/day in a typical human weighing 50 kg) in single or divided doses, regardless of route of administration. A more preferred dosage range is from about 0.15 mg/kg/day to about 250 mg/kg/day.	[0085] Of course, depending on the specific circumstances (for example, the presence or absence of a predisposition to the disease or condition being treated, the severity or expected severity of the disease, or the age or general health of the patient), even doses outside the aforementioned ranges may be in order. The particular dose given the specific circumstances can be determined by a physician or other health-care professional of ordinary skill.	[0086] The NR2B subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonist useful in the method of the present invention is generally administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more NR2B subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonists together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.	[0087] The compositions described herein useful in the present invention are generally formulated in a conventional manner utilizing solid or liquid vehicles or diluents as appropriate to the mode of administration. For purposes of oral administration, tablets containing excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium, carbonate and dicalcium phosphate may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as, but not limited to, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft elastic and hard-filled gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include, by way of example and not of limitation, lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active ingredient may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.	[0088] The present invention is illustrated by the following examples, but is not limited to the details thereof.	[0089] All nonaqueous reactions were run under nitrogen for convenience and generally to maximize yields. All solvents/diluents were dried according to standard published procedures or purchased in a predried form. All reactions were stirred either magnetically or mechanically. NMR spectra are recorded at 300 MHz and are reported in ppm. The NMR solvent was CDCl3 unless otherwise specified. IR spectra are reported in cm−1, generally specifying only strong signals.	EXAMPLE 1	Enantiomeric (1S, 2S)- and (1R, 2R)-1-(4-Hydroxy-phenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidin-1-yl)-1-propanol	[0090] (+)-Tartaric acid (300 mg, 2 mmol) was dissolved in 30 mL warm methanol. Racemic 1S*, 2S*-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidin-1-yl)-1-propanol (655 mg, 2 mmol) was added all at once. With stirring and gentle warming a colorless homogeneous solution was obtained. Upon standing at ambient temperature 24 hours, 319 mg (66%) of a fluffy white precipitate was obtained. This product was recrystallized from methanol to give 263 mg of the (+)-tartrate salt of levorotatory title product as a white solid; mp 206.5-207.5° C.; [alpha]D=−36.2°. This salt (115 mg) was added to 50 mL of saturated NaHCO3. Ethyl acetate (5 mL) was added and the mixture was vigorously stirred 30 minutes. The aqueous phase was repeatedly extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined and washed with brine, dried over calcium sulfate, and concentrated. The tan residue was recrystallized from ethyl acetate-hexane to give 32 mg (39%) of white, levorotatory title product; mp 203-204° C.; [alpha]D=−58.4°. Anal. Calc'd. for C20H25NO3: C, 73.37; H, 7.70; N, 4.28. Found: C, 72.61; H, 7.45; N, 421.	[0091] The filtrate from the (+)-tartrate salt preparation above was treated with 100 mL saturated aqueous NaHCO3, and extracted well with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over calcium sulfate and concentrated to give 380 mg of recovered starting material (partially resolved). This material was treated with (−)-tartaric acid (174 mg) in 30 mL of methanol as above. After standing for 24 hours, filtration gave 320 mg (66%) of product which was further recrystallized from methanol to produce 239 mg of the (−)-tartrate salt of dextrorotatory title product; mp 206.5-207.5° C. [alpha]D=:+33.9°. The latter was converted to dextrorotatory title product in the manner above in 49% yield; mp 204-205° C.; [alpha]D=+56.9°. Anal. Found: C, 72.94; H, 7.64; N, 424.	EXAMPLE 2	(1S, 2S)-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidin-yl)-1-propanol methanesulfonate trihydrate	[0092]	7	[0093] A 50 gallon glass lined reactor was charged with 17.1 gallons of acetone, 8.65 kilograms (kg) (57.7 mol) of 4′-hydroxypropiophenone, 9.95 kg (72.0 mol) of potassium carbonate and 6.8 liters (I) (57.7 mol) of benzylbromide. The mixture was heated to reflux (56° C.) for 20 hours. Analysis of thin layer chromatography (TLC) revealed that the reaction was essentially complete. The suspension was atmospherically concentrated to a volume of 10 gallons and 17.1 gallons of water were charged. The suspension was granulated at 25° C. for 1 hour. The product was filtered on a 30″ Lapp and washed with 4.6 gallons of water followed by a mixture of 6.9 gallons of hexane and 2.3 gallons of isopropanol. After vacuum drying at 45° C., this yielded 13.35 kg (96.4%) of the above-depicted product.	[0094] A second run was carried out with 9.8 kg (65.25 mol) of 4′-hydroxypropiophenone using the procedure described above. After drying 15.1 kg (96.3%) of the above-depicted product was obtained.	8	[0095] Under a nitrogen atmosphere, a 100 gallon glass lined reactor was charged with 75 gallons of methylene chloride and 28.2 kg (117.5 mol) of the product from step 1. The solution was stirred five minutes and then 18.8 kg of bromine was charged. The reaction was stirred for 0.5 hours at 22° C. Analysis of TLC revealed that the reaction was essentially complete. To the solution was charged 37 gallons of water and the mixture was stirred for 15 minutes. The methylene chloride was separated and washed with 18.5 gallons of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The methylene chloride was separated, atmospherically concentrated to a volume of 40 gallons and 60 gallons of isopropanol was charged. The concentration was continued until a pot temperature of 80° C. and final volume of 40 gallons were obtained. The suspension was cooled to 20° C. and granulated for 18 hours. The product was filtered on a 30″ Lapp and washed with 10 gallons of isopropanol.

The solution was heated to reflux (77° C.) for 18 hours. The resulting suspension was cooled to 20° C. Analysis by TLC revealed that the reaction was essentially complete. The byproduct (triethylamine hydrobromide salt) was filtered on a 30″ Lapp and washed with 4 gallons of ethyl acetate. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to a volume of 17 liters. The concentrate was charged to 48 liters of hexane and the resulting suspension granulated for 2 hours at 20° C. The product was filtered on a 30″ Lapp and washed with 4 gallons of hexane. After vacuum drying at 50° C., this yielded 4.9 kg (77%) of the above-depicted product.	[0097] A second run was carried out with 3.6 kg (11.3 mol) of the product from step 2 using the procedure described above. After drying 4.1 kg (87%) of the above-depicted product was obtained.	10	[0098] Under a nitrogen atmosphere, a 100 gallon glass lined reactor was charged with 87.0 gallons of 2B ethanol and 1.7 kg (45.2 mol) of sodium borohydride. The resulting solution was stirred at 25° C. and 9.4 kg (22.6 mol) of the product from step 3 was charged. The suspension was stirred for 18 hours at 25-30° C. Analysis by TLC revealed that the reaction was essentially complete to the desired threo diastereoisomer. To the suspension was charged 7.8 liters of water. The suspension was concentrated under vacuum to a volume of 40 gallons. After granulating for 1 hour, the product was filtered on a 30″ Lapp and washed with 2 gallons of 2B ethanol. The wet product, 9.4 gallons of 2B-ethanol and 8.7 gallons of water were charged to a 100 gallon glass lined reactor. The suspension was stirred at reflux (78° C.) for 16 hours.

TECHNICAL FIELD	The invention relates to 3-quinuclidinyl heteroatom bridged biaryl derivatives, compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of treating conditions and disorders using such compounds and compositions.	DESCRIPTION OF RELATED TECHNOLOGY	Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely distributed throughout the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems. Such receptors play an important role in regulating CNS function, particularly by modulating release of a wide range of neurotransmitters, including, but not necessarily limited to acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and GABA. Consequently, nicotinic receptors mediate a very wide range of physiological effects, and have been targeted for therapeutic treatment of disorders relating to cognitive function, learning and memory, neurodegeneration, pain and inflammation, psychosis and sensory gating, mood and emotion, among others.	Many subtypes of the nAChR exist in the CNS and periphery. Each subtype has a different effect on regulating the overall physiological function. Typically, nAChRs are ion channels that are constructed from a pentameric assembly of subunit proteins. At least 12 subunit proteins, α2-α10 and β2-β4, have been identified in neuronal tissue. These subunits provide for a great variety of homomeric and heteromeric combinations that account for the diverse receptor subtypes. For example, the predominant receptor that is responsible for high affinity binding of nicotine in brain tissue has composition (α4)2(β2)3 (the α4β2 subtype), while another major population of receptors is comprised of the homomeric (α7)5 (the α7 subtype).	Certain compounds, like the plant alkaloid nicotine, interact with all subtypes of the nAChRs, accounting for the profound physiological effects of this compound. While nicotine has been demonstrated to have many beneficial properties, not all of the effects mediated by nicotine are desirable. For example, nicotine exerts gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects that interfere at therapeutic doses, and its addictive nature and acute toxicity are well-known. Ligands that are selective for interaction with only certain subtypes of the nAChR offer potential for achieving beneficial therapeutic effects with an improved margin for safety.	The α7 nAChRs have been shown to play a significant role in enhancing cognitive function, including aspects of learning, memory and attention (Levin, E. D., J. Neurobiol. 53: 633-640, 2002). For example, α7 nAChRs have been linked to conditions and disorders related to attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, senile dementia, dementia associated with Lewy bodies, dementia associated with Down's syndrome, AIDS dementia, Pick's Disease, as well as cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, among other systemic activities. The activity at the α7 nAChRs can be modified or regulated by the administration of α7 nAChR ligands. The ligands can exhibit antagonist, agonist, partial agonist, or inverse agonist properties. Thus, α7 ligands have potential in treatment of various cognitive disorders.	Although various classes of compounds demonstrating α7 nAChR-modulating activity exist, it would be beneficial to provide additional compounds demonstrating activity at the α7 nAChRs that can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions useful for therapeutic methods. Specifically, it would be beneficial to provide compounds that interact selectively with α7-containing neuronal nAChRs compared to other subtypes.

More particularly, the Boc protecting group may be removed by treatment with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid. The Cbz and Bn protecting groups may be removed by catalytic hydrogenation. The acetyl and trifluoracetyl protecting groups may be removed by a hydroxide ion.

Longman Scientific & Technical, Essex CM20 2JE, England.	The compounds of the invention have at least one basic nitrogen whereby the compound can be treated with an acid to form a desired salt. For example, a compound may be reacted with an acid at or above room temperature to provide the desired salt, which is deposited, and collected by filtration after cooling. Examples of acids suitable for the reaction include, but are not limited to tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, as well as mandelic, atrolactic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, carbonic, fumaric, gluconic, acetic, propionic, salicylic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulfuric, citric, or hydroxybutyric acid, camphorsulfonic, malic, phenylacetic, aspartic, glutamic, and the like.	COMPOSITIONS OF THE INVENTION	The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions comprise compounds of the invention formulated together with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection or for rectal administration.	The term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,” as used herein, means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of one skilled in the art of formulations.	The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other mammals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term “parenterally,” as used herein, refers to modes of administration, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous, intraarticular injection and infusion.	Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, and the like, and suitable mixtures thereof), vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate, or suitable mixtures thereof. Suitable fluidity of the composition may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.	These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservative agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It also can be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.	In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug can depend upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, a parenterally administered drug form can be administered by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.	Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, can contain suspending agents, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.	If desired, and for more effective distribution, the compounds of the invention can be incorporated into slow-release or targeted-delivery systems such as polymer matrices, liposomes, and microspheres. They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter or by incorporation of sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions, which may be dissolved in sterile water or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.	Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides) Depot injectable formulations also are prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.	The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.	Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation also can be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic, parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.	Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, one or more compounds of the invention is mixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and salicylic acid; b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay; and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.	Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols.	The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They can optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of materials useful for delaying release of the active agent can include polymeric substances and waxes.	Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.	Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.

Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons.	Compounds of the invention also can be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes may be used. The present compositions in liposome form may contain, in addition to the compounds of the invention, stabilizers, preservatives, and the like. The preferred lipids are the natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidylcholines (lecithins) used separately or together.	Methods to form liposomes are known in the art.

Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, V. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press (1987).	The invention contemplates pharmaceutically active compounds either chemically synthesized or formed by in vivo biotransformation to compounds of formula (I).	METHODS OF THE INVENTION	Compounds and compositions of the invention are useful for modulating the effects of nAChRs, and more particularly α7 nAChRs. In particular, the compounds and compositions of the invention can be used for treating and preventing disorders modulated by α7 nAChRs. Typically, such disorders can be ameliorated by selectively modulating the α7 nAChRs in a mammal, preferably by administering a compound or composition of the invention, either alone or in combination with another active agent, for example, as part of a therapeutic regimen.	The compounds of the invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples, possess an affinity for nAChRs, and more particularly α7 nAChRs. As α7 nAChRs ligands, the compounds of the invention can be useful for the treatment and prevention of a number of α7 nAChR-mediated diseases or conditions.	For example, α7 nAChRs have been shown to play a significant role in enhancing cognitive function, including aspects of learning, memory and attention (Levin, E. D., J. Neurobiol. 53: 633-640, 2002). As such, α7 ligands are suitable for the treatment of cognitive disorders including, for example, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, senile dementia, AIDS dementia, Pick's Disease, dementia associated with Lewy bodies, and dementia associated with Down's syndrome, as well as cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.	In addition, α7-containing nAChRs have been shown to be involved in the neuroprotective effects of nicotine both in vitro (Jonnala, R. B. and Buccafusco, J. J., J. Neurosci. Res. 66: 565-572, 2001) and in vivo (Shimohama, S. et al., Brain Res. 779: 359-363, 1998). More particularly, neurodegeneration underlies several progressive CNS disorders, including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, as well as diminished CNS function resulting from traumatic brain injury. For example, the impaired function of α7 nAChRs by β-amyloid peptides linked to Alzheimer's disease has been implicated as a key factor in development of the cognitive deficits associated with the disease (Liu, Q.-S., Kawai, H., Berg, D. K., PNAS 98: 4734-4739, 2001). The activation of α7 nAChRs has been shown to block this neurotoxicity (Kihara, T. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276: 13541-13546, 2001). As such, selective ligands that enhance α7 activity can counter the deficits of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.	Schizophrenia is a complex disease that is characterized by abnormalities in perception, cognition, and emotions. Significant evidence implicates the involvement of α7 nAChRs in this disease, including a measured deficit of these receptors in post-mortem patients (Leonard, S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 393: 237-242, 2000). Deficits in sensory processing (gating) are one of the hallmarks of schizophrenia. These deficits can be normalized by nicotinic ligands that operate at the α7 nAChR (Adler L. E. et al., Schizophrenia Bull. 24: 189-202, 1998; Stevens, K. E. et al., Psychopharmacology 136: 320-327, 1998). Thus, α7 ligands demonstrate potential in the treatment schizophrenia.	Angiogenesis, a process involved in the growth of new blood vessels, is important in beneficial systemic functions, such as wound healing, vascularization of skin grafts, and enhancement of circulation, for example, increased circulation around a vascular occlusion. Non-selective nAChR agonists like nicotine have been shown to stimulate angiogenesis (Heeschen, C. et al., Nature Medicine 7: 833-839, 2001). Improved angiogenesis has been shown to involve activation of the α7 nAChR (Heeschen, C. et al, J. Clin. Invest. 110: 527-536, 2002). Therefore, nAChR ligands that are selective for the α7 subtype offer improved potential for stimulating angiogenesis with an improved side effect profile.	A population of α7 nAChRs in the spinal cord modulate serotonergic transmission that have been associated with the pain-relieving effects of nicotinic compounds (Cordero-Erausquin, M. and Changeux, J.-P. PNAS 98: 2803-2807, 2001). The α7 nAChR ligands demonstrate therapeutic potential for the treatment of pain states, including acute pain, post-surgical pain, as well as chronic pain states including inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. Moreover, α7 nAChRs are expressed on the surface of primary macrophages that are involved in the inflammation response, and that activation of the α7 receptor inhibits release of TNF and other cytokines that trigger the inflammation response (Wang, H. et al Nature 421: 384-388, 2003). Therefore, selective α7 ligands demonstrate potential for treating conditions involving inflammation and pain.	The mammalian sperm acrosome reaction is an exocytosis process important in fertilization of the ovum by sperm. Activation of an α7 nAChR on the sperm cell has been shown to be essential for the acrosome reaction (Son, J.-H. and Meizel, S. Biol. Reproduct. 68: 1348-1353 2003). Consequently, selective α7 agents demonstrate utility for treating fertility disorders.	Compounds of the invention are particularly useful for treating and preventing a condition or disorder affecting cognition, neurodegeneration, and schizophrenia.	Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia often limits the ability of patients to function normally, a symptom not adequately treated by commonly available treatments, for example, treatment with an atypical antipsychotic. (Rowley, M. et al., J. Med. Chem. 44: 477-501, 2001). Such cognitive deficit has been linked to dysfunction of the nicotinic cholinergic system, in particular with decreased activity at α7 receptors. (Friedman, J. I. et al., Biol Psychiatry, 51: 349-357, 2002). Thus, activators of α7 receptors can provide useful treatment for enhancing cognitive function in schizophrenic patients who are being treated with atypical antipsychotics. Accordingly, the combination of an α7 nAChR ligand and an atypical antipsychotic would offer improved therapeutic utility. Specific examples of suitable atypical antipsychotics include, but are not limited to, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quietapine, ziprasidone, zotepine, iloperidone, and the like.	Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound(s) that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, compositions and mode of administration. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.	When used in the above or other treatments, a therapeutically effective amount of one of the compounds of the invention can be employed in pure form or, where such forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide or prodrug form. Alternatively, the compound can be administered as a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound of interest in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The phrase “therapeutically effective amount” of the compound of the invention means a sufficient amount of the compound to treat disorders, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well-known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.	The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human or lower animal range from about 0.10 mg/kg body weight to about 1 g/kg body weight. More preferable doses can be in the range of from about 0.10 mg/kg body weight to about 100 mg/kg body weight. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently, single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose.	The compounds and processes of the invention will be better understood by reference to the following examples and reference examples, which are intended as an illustration of and not a limitation upon the scope of the invention.

Example 35	Determination of Biological Activity	To determine the effectiveness of representative compounds of this invention as α7 nAChRs, the compounds of the invention were evaluated according to the [3H]-methyllycaconitine (MLA) binding assay and considering the [3H]-cytisine binding assay, which were performed as described below.	[3H]-Cytisine Binding	Binding conditions were modified from the procedures described in Pabreza L A, Dhawan, S, Kellar K J, [3H]-Cytisine Binding to Nicotinic Cholinergic Receptors in Brain, Mol. Pharm. 39: 9-12,1991. Membrane enriched fractions from rat brain minus cerebellum (ABS Inc., Wilmington, Del.) were slowly thawed at 4° C., washed and resuspended in 30 volumes of BSS-Tris buffer (120 mM NaCl/5 mM KCl/2 mM CaCl2/2 mM MgCl2/50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 4° C.). Samples containing 100-200 μg of protein and 0.75 nM [3H]-cytisine (30 Ci/mmol; Perkin Elmer/NEN Life Science Products, Boston, Mass.) were incubated in a final volume of 500 μL for 75 minutes at 4° C. Seven log-dilution concentrations of each compound were tested in duplicate. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM (−)-nicotine. Bound radioactivity was isolated by vacuum filtration onto prewetted glass fiber filter plates (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) using a 96-well filtration apparatus (Packard Instruments, Meriden, Conn.) and were then rapidly rinsed with 2 mL of ice-cold BSS buffer (120 mM NaCl/5 mM KCl/2 mM CaCl2/2 mM MgCl2). Packard MicroScint-20® scintillation cocktail (40 μL) was added to each well and radioactivity determined using a Packard TopCount® instrument. The IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression in Microsoft Excel® software. Ki values were calculated from the IC50s using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, where Ki=IC50/1+[Ligand]/KD].	[3H]-Methyllycaconitine (MLA) Binding	Binding conditions were similar to those for [3H]-cytisine binding. Membrane enriched fractions from rat brain minus cerebellum (ABS Inc., Wilmington, Del.) were slowly thawed at 4° C., washed and resuspended in 30 volumes of BSS-Tris buffer (120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 22° C.). Samples containing 100-200 μg of protein, 5 nM [3H]-MLA (25 Ci/mmol; Perkin Elmer/NEN Life Science Products, Boston, Mass.) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) were incubated in a final volume of 500 μL for 60 minutes at 22° C. Seven log-dilution concentrations of each compound were tested in duplicate. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM MLA. Bound radioactivity was isolated by vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filter plates prewetted with 2% BSA using a 96-well filtration apparatus (Packard Instruments, Meriden, Conn.) and were then rapidly rinsed with 2 mL of ice-cold BSS. Packard MicroScint-20® scintillation cocktail (40 μL) was added to each well and radioactivity was determined using a Packard TopCount® instrument. The IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression in Microsoft Excel® software. Ki values were calculated from the IC50s using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, where Ki=IC50/1+[Ligand]/KD].	Compounds of the invention had Ki values of from about 1 nanomolar to about 10 micromolar when tested by the MLA assay, many having a Ki of less than 1 micromolar. [3H]-Cytisine binding values of compounds of the invention ranged from about 50 nanomolar to at least 100 micromolar. The determination of preferred compounds typically considered the Ki value as measured by MLA assay in view of the Ki value as measured by [3H]-cytisine binding, such that in the formula D=Ki 3H-cytisine/Ki MLA, D is about 50. Preferred compounds typically exhibited greater potency at α7 receptors compared to α4β2 receptors.	Compounds of the invention are α7 nAChRs ligands that modulate function of α7 nAChRs by altering the activity of the receptor. The compounds can be inverse agonists that inhibit the basal activity of the receptor or antagonists that completely block the action of receptor-activating agonists. The compounds also can be partial agonists that partially block or partially activate the α7 nAChR receptor or agonists that activate the receptor.

No. 09/843,598, filed Apr. 26, 2001, which claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/200,549, filed on Apr. 26, 2000, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.	STATEMENT AS TO FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH	This research was funded, in part, by NIH Grant R37GM24663. The U.S. government has certain rights to the invention.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION	The field of this invention is the identification and analysis of compounds that modulate biological activity.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	The functions of serotonin in mammals are numerous and include control of appetite, sleep, memory and learning, temperature regulation, mood (e.g., depression), behavior (including sexual and hallucinogenic behavior), cardiovascular function, muscle contraction, and endocrine regulation. Small molecules that manipulate serotonin neurotransmission include drugs of major importance and provide a sizable percentage of the revenue of the pharmaceutical industry. These drugs include the first generation tricyclic antidepressants, such as amytryptyline, imipramine, and chlomipramine; serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine; monoamine oxidase inhibitors; other antidepressants, such as citalopram; migraine medications, such as sumatriptan and rizatriptan; and anti-emetics, such as granisetron and ondansetron. The site of action of the reuptake inhibitors and many of the other drugs listed above is purported to be the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT). SERTs have been cloned from numerous species, including Drosophila melanogaster, mice, and humans. The cloning of SERTs from numerous species has facilitated extensive structure-function and pharmacological studies, where the conservation of amino acid residues during evolution has provided key insights into the regions of the transporter that are relevant for serotonin binding and transport, as well as for the binding of the various drugs that affect the function of the transporter.	Drugs acting at SERTs, however, have many side effects, and very little is known about the mechanism(s) causing these side effects. Drug side effects are detrimental in several ways. They prevent drugs from being used at doses that might be more effective at treating the primary indication, and sometimes the side effects may be so prohibitively noxious that a particular compound never reaches the market, or can only be used with a subset of the patient population for which it might otherwise be effective. An understanding of the causes of these side effects and determination of the genes and pathways that are affected would allow the use of rational drug design and/or combination drug therapy, leading to more efficient, safe, and better tolerated drugs.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	The invention features methods for testing whether a compound that modulates CeSERT activity has a secondary target. These methods are useful in determining if a compound has any side effects, as a consequence of interacting with a secondary target, and will therefore aid in the identification of therapeutic compounds that provide optimal serotonergic biological function with minimal side effects. In addition, the present invention encompasses C. elegans SERT (CeSERT) genes and polypeptides, as well as methods for identifying compounds that modulate CeSERT biological activity. These compounds may be used as therapeutic agents in the treatment of serotonin-mediated conditions.	Accordingly, the first aspect of the invention features a method for determining the activity range of a test compound, which modulates the uptake of serotonin by a serotonin reuptake transporter, against a secondary target. This method includes the steps of: (a) contacting a first nematode expressing a mutated CeSERT polypeptide, where the mutated CeSERT polypeptide has a reduced capacity to take up serotonin relative to wild-type, with the compound; (b) assaying a defined behavior of the first nematode; (c) assaying the defined behavior of a second nematode not contacted with the compound; and (d) comparing the defined behavior of the first nematode to that of the second nematode, where a difference in the defined behavior between the first and second nematode indicates that the compound has a secondary target.	In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, steps (a) to (d) are repeated using first and second nematodes selected from a panel of nematodes expressing mutant CeSERT polypetides, wherein the mutant CeSERT polypeptides differ from the mutated CeSERT polypeptide of step (a). For example, a mutated CeSERT polypeptide may be a complete loss-of-function. In addition, the mutated CeSERT polypeptide may be a CeSERT(n822) polypeptide, a CeSERT(n823) polypeptide, or a CeSERT(n3314) polypeptide.	In another embodiment, the method of this aspect may include a liquid locomotion assay. Furthermore, the defined behavior may be movement, pharyngeal pumping, egg-laying, nose contraction, or defecation.	In an additional embodiment, the compound is from a class of compounds selected from a group including antidepressants, migraine medications, and anti-emetics. For example, an antidepressant may be a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, a tricyclic antidepressant, or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. In another embodiment of this aspect, the test compound may administered at more than one concentration.	In a further aspect, the invention features a method, e.g., a liquid locomotion assay, for identifying a compound that modulates the biological activity of a serotonin reuptake transporter. This method includes the steps of: (a) exposing at least one first nematode to a test compound; (b) quantifying the number of these first nematodes exhibiting a defined behavior after exposure to the test compound; (c) quantifying the number of second nematodes exhibiting the defined behavior, wherein the second, control nematodes are not exposed to the test compound; and (d) comparing the number of the first or second nematodes exhibiting the defined behavior to the total number of first or second nematodes to obtain the relative number of first or second nematodes exhibiting the defined behavior, where a difference in the relative number of first and second nematodes exhibiting the defined behavior indicates that a compound modulates the biological activity of a serotonin reuptake transporter. However, the number of the first and second nematodes not exhibiting the defined behavior may also be quantified.	In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the defined behavior may be movement (e.g., swimming).	In addition, the first and second nematodes of this aspect of the invention may express a wild-type or a mutated CeSERT gene. For example, the mutated CeSERT gene may express a truncated CeSERT polypeptide, which in turn may function as a wild-type CeSERT polypeptide. However, the mutated CeSERT gene may also be a CeSERT(n822), CeSERT(n823), or CeSERT(n3314) gene. In a further embodiment, the first and second nematode may express a mammalian SERT gene such as a human hSERT gene.	In another preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the test compound is applied at more than one concentration. In addition, the second nematode may be, for example, receiving serotonin or a placebo. Furthermore, a compound affecting the serotonergic pathway may be administered in addition to the test compound.	In a further preferred embodiment, the first and second nematode has been bacterial-lawn deprived prior to beginning the assay and the test compound may be administered in the presence or absence of serotonin.	In additional preferred embodiments, the modulation is agonistic, resulting in increased serotonin reuptake transporter biological activity relative to a control, or antagonistic, resulting in decreased serotonin reuptake transporter biological activity relative to a control.	In another embodiment, a condition in a subject is treated by administering, to a subject, a compound that was identified according to the method of this aspect of the invention. Examples of conditions that may be treated according to the method of this aspect of the invention include loss of appetite, gain of appetite, insomnia, an inability to wake up, memory loss, loss of the ability to learn, decreased ability to regulate body temperature, abnormal mood, abnormal behavior, abnormal cardiovascular function, abnormal muscle contraction, abnormal endocrine regulation, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal cramps, a migraine, a panic disorder, and an obsessive compulsive disorder. An abnormal mood may be, for example, increased depression or mania, whereas abnormal behavior may be, for example, sexual or hallucinogenic. Furthermore, the compound may be an agonist, resulting in increased serotonin reuptake transporter biological activity relative to a control, or an antagonist, resulting in decreased serotonin reuptake transporter biological activity relative to a control.	In an additional aspect, the invention features a substantially pure nucleic acid encoding a CeSERT polypeptide that is at least 45% identical to SEQ ID NO:5, where the CeSERT polypeptide modulates the uptake of serotonin by a synaptic neuron.	A further aspect of the invention features a substantially pure nucleic acid encoding a CeSERT polypeptide that is at least 45% identical to SEQ ID NOS:6, 7 or 8, where the CeSERT polypeptide has a reduced capacity to modulate the uptake of serotonin by a synaptic neuron, relative to wild-type. For example, the substantially pure nucleic acid may encode a polypeptide containing a stop codon at a position equivalent to position 225 of SEQ ID NO:6, or a polypeptide containing a serine at a position equivalent to position 569 of SEQ ID NO:7. In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the substantially pure nucleic acid encodes a polypeptide including SEQ ID NO:8.	In another aspect, the invention features a Caenorhabditis elegans strain including a CeSERT nucleic acid, where this CeSERT nucleic acid encodes a polypeptide that is at least 45% identical to a polypeptide of SEQ ID NOS:6, 7, or 8. The CeSERT(n822) and CeSERT(n823) polypeptides are specifically excluded from this aspect of the invention. In a preferred embodiment of this aspect, the Caenorhabditis elegans encodes a CeSERT(n3314) polypeptide.	Another aspect of the invention features a substantially pure CeSERT polypeptide that is at least 45% identical to SEQ ID NO:5, where the CeSERT polypeptide modulates the uptake of serotonin by a synaptic neuron.	In a further aspect, the invention features a substantially pure CeSERT polypeptide that is at least 45% identical to SEQ ID NOS:6, 7 or 8, where this CeSERT polypeptide has a reduced capacity to modulate the uptake of serotonin by a synaptic neuron. In a preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the substantially pure CeSERT polypeptide contains a stop codon at a position equivalent to position 225 of SEQ ID NO:6 or contains a serine at a position equivalent to position 569 of SEQ ID NO:7. In addition the substantially pure CeSERT polypeptide may include SEQ ID NO:8.	The final aspect, the invention features a transgenic animal including a CeSERT nucleic acid of SEQ ID NOS:1, 2, 3, or 4. This transgenic animal may be, for example, a nematode or a mammal, such as a mouse. In other preferred embodiments, the transgenic animal over-expresses the CeSERT nucleic acid, or expresses a dominant-negative CeSERT polypeptide.	Definitions	By a “substantially pure nucleic acid” or “substantially pure DNA” is meant a nucleic acid that is free of the genes that, in the naturally-occurring genome of the organism from which the nucleic acid of the invention is derived, flank the gene. The term therefore includes, for example, a recombinant DNA that is incorporated into a vector; into an autonomously replicating plasmid or virus; or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote; or that exists as a separate molecule (e.g., a cDNA or a genomic or cDNA fragment produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease digestion) independent of other sequences. It also includes recombinant DNA that is part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide sequence.	By a “SERT gene” or “mod-5 gene” is meant a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide that is a serotonin reuptake transporter. In one embodiment, the SERT gene is a C. elegans gene and is known as a “CeSERT gene.” In another embodiment the SERT gene is a human gene and is known as an “hSERT gene.”	By a “substantially pure polypeptide” is meant a polypeptide that has been separated from the components that naturally accompany it. Typically, the polypeptide is substantially pure when it is at least 60%, by weight, free from the proteins and naturally-occurring organic molecules with which it is naturally associated. Preferably the polypeptide is a serotonin reuptake transporter polypeptide that is at least 75%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 99%, by weight, pure. A substantially pure serotonin reuptake transporter polypeptide may be obtained, for example, by extraction from a natural source (e.g., a neuron or smooth muscle cell) by expression of a recombinant nucleic acid encoding a serotonin reuptake transporter polypeptide, or by chemically synthesizing the protein. Purity can be assayed by any appropriate method (e.g., by column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, agarose gel electrophoresis, optical density, or HPLC analysis).	A protein is substantially free of naturally associated components when it is separated from those contaminants that accompany it in its natural state. Thus, a protein that is chemically synthesized or produced in a cellular system different from the cell from which it naturally originates will be substantially free from its naturally associated components. Accordingly, substantially pure polypeptides include those derived from eukaryotic organisms but synthesized in E. coli or other prokaryotes.	By a “SERT protein,” “SERT polypeptide,” “MOD-5 protein,” or “MOD-5 polypeptide” is meant a polypeptide or fragment thereof, encoded by a SERT gene. In one embodiment, the SERT protein or polypeptide is from C. elegans, and such a protein or polypeptide is known as “CeSERT.” In another embodiment, the SERT protein is human, and is also referred to as “hSERT.”	By a “CeSERT(n822) gene” or “mod-5(n822) gene” is meant a CeSERT gene having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2.	By a “CeSERT(n822) polypeptide” or “MOD-5(n822) polypeptide” is meant a CeSERT polypeptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:6.	By a “CeSERT(n823) gene” or “mod-5(n823) gene” is meant a CeSERT gene having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:3.

By a “CeSERT(n3314) gene” or “mod-5(n3314) gene” is meant a CeSERT gene having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:4.	By a “CeSERT(n3314) polypeptide” or “MOD-5(n3314) polypeptide” is meant a CeSERT polypeptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:8.	By “substantially identical” is meant a polypeptide or nucleic acid exhibiting at least 45%, more preferably 55%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and most preferably 95% identity to a reference amino acid sequence (for example, an amino acid sequence described herein) or nucleic acid sequence (for example, a nucleic acid sequence described herein). For polypeptides, the length of comparison sequences will generally be at least 15 amino acids, preferably at least 20 amino acids, more preferably at least 35 amino acids, and most preferably over the full length of the polypeptide. For nucleic acids, the length of comparison sequences will generally be at least 60 nucleotides, preferably at least 75 nucleotides, more preferably 110 nucleotides, and most preferably over the full length of the nucleic acid sequence. As used herein a nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence may be substantially identical to a wild-type or mutated CeSERT nucleic acid or polypeptide.	Sequence identity is typically measured using sequence analysis software with the default parameters specified therein (e.g., Sequence Analysis Software Package of the Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, 1710 University Avenue, Madison, Wis. 53705, BLAST, or PILEUP/PRETTYBOX programs). These software programs match identical or similar sequences by assigning degrees of identity to various substitutions, deletions, and/or other modifications. Conservative substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups: glycine, alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine; aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, glutamine; serine, threonine; lysine, arginine; and phenylalanine, tyrosine.	By “polypeptide analogs,” as referred to herein, is meant a polypeptide that generally exhibits at least 85%, more preferably 90%, and most preferably 95% or even 99% identity with all or part of a naturally-occurring amino acid sequence, for example the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS:5, 6, 7, and 8. The length of sequence comparison is at least 15 amino acid residues, preferably at least 25 amino acid residues, and more preferably more than 35 amino acid residues.	As used herein, the term “polypeptide fragment” means at least 20 contiguous amino acids, preferably at least 30 contiguous amino acids, more preferably at least 50 contiguous amino acids, and most preferably at least 60 to 80 or more contiguous amino acids.	By “degenerate variants” is meant nucleic acid sequences that encode the same polypeptide as a result of the redundancy of the genetic code. For example, the codon for leucine can be any one of six different codons, and the nucleotides comprising these six codons are degenerate variants.	By “high stringency conditions” is meant conditions that are commonly understood in the art as stringent. An exemplary set of high stringency conditions include a temperature of 60-70° C. (preferably about 65° C.) and a salt concentration of 0.70 M to 0.80 M (preferably about 0.75 M). Further exemplary conditions include hybridization conditions that (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example, 0.015 M NaCl/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% SDS at 50° C.; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (vol/vol) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrolidone/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM NaCl, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42° C.; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5×SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 g/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42° C., with washes at 42° C. in 0.2×SSC and 0.1% SDS. Further examples of stringent conditions can be found in Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1989, or Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., 1994.	By “treatment” is meant the submission or subjection of an animal, cell, lysate or extract derived from a cell, or molecule derived from a cell to a test compound or stimulus to a serotonin-mediated response.	By a “test compound” is meant a chemical, be it naturally-occurring or artificially-derived, that is surveyed for its ability to modulate serotonin-mediated cellular responses, by employing one of the assay methods described herein. Test compounds may include, for example, peptides, polypeptides, synthetic organic molecules, naturally-occurring organic molecules, nucleic acid molecules, and components thereof.	By a “control compound” is meant a chemical, be it naturally-occurring or artificially derived, that has a known effect, or no effect, on an organism. For example, a control compound may be a placebo.	By “treat” is meant to submit or subject an animal, cell, lysate or extract derived from a cell, or molecule derived from a cell to a test compound or stimulus to a serotonin-mediated response.	
US20050166270_0003	“Mutated” or “mutant,” as used herein, refers to different from what normally appears, occurs, or functions. As used herein, the term refers to a nucleic acid or polypeptide containing a sequence that is different from the wild-type sequence. Such a difference in sequence may be, for example, a single nucleic or amino acid change, but it may also include deletions or insertions of multiple nucleic or amino acids. The term mutant also means an organism that carries a mutant nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence. As used herein, the mutant nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence is, for example, CeSERT or hSERT.	By “biological activity” is meant a functional event mediated by a protein. In one embodiment, this includes the level of sensitivity to serotonin (exogenous or endogenous). It also includes interactions of a polypeptide with another polypeptide, as well as events that modify behavior or behavioral states. Such behavior includes, but is not limited to, movement, sexual behavior, mood, or hallucinogenic behavior. Behavioral states include, but are not limited to, loss of appetite, gain of appetite, insomnia, inability to wake up, memory loss, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal cramps, ability or inability to learn, body temperature deregulation, migraines, moods, such as depression or mania, panic disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, abnormal cardiovascular function, abnormal muscle contraction, and abnormal endocrine regulation.	In C. elegans, biological activity includes, but is not limited to, locomotion, egg-laying, pharyngeal pumping, nose contraction, and defecation.	By “defined behavior,” as used herein, is meant, for example, movement, sexual behavior, mood, or hallucinogenic behavior. In C. elegans, “defined behavior” includes, but is not limited to, movement, nose contraction, egg-laying, pharyngeal pumping, and defecation. An example of movement is swimming behavior. In addition, a “defined behavior” may refer to the rate at which a behavior is carried out, for example, the rate of movement or of egg-laying.	As used herein, by “modulates” is meant increasing or decreasing the biological activity. Preferably the biological activity is increased or decreased 10% relative to a control. More preferably the biological activity is increased or decreased 50% relative to a control. Most preferably the biological activity is increased or decreased 90% relative to a control.	By “reduced capacity to take up serotonin,” as used herein, is meant a reduction of least 10% in the ability of a cell, for example a synaptic neuron, to take up serotonin, relative to wild-type. More preferably, the reduction is at least 25%, 50%, or 75%. Most preferably, the reduction is at least 85%.

By “relative number,” as used herein, is meant a number that can be used for direct comparisons, for example, a percentage.	By “assaying” is meant analyzing the effect of a treatment or exposure, be it chemical or physical, administered to whole animals or cells derived from such an animal. The material being analyzed may be an animal, a cell, a lysate or extract derived from a cell, or a molecule derived from a cell. The analysis may be, for example, for the purpose of detecting the level of sensitivity of a cell or animal to serotonin, alterations in locomotion, egg-laying, pharyngeal pumping or defecation behaviors of an animal, altered gene expression, altered nucleic acid stability (e.g., mRNA stability), altered protein stability, altered protein levels, altered protein biological activity, or a side effect caused by a compound. The means for analyzing may include, for example, counting movements of an animal under a microscope, observing the behavior of a nematode in the presence of a compound, nucleic acid amplification techniques, utilizing gene chip or DNA array technologies, reporter gene assays, antibody labeling, immunoprecipitation, and phosphorylation assays and other techniques known in the art for conducting the analysis of the invention.	“Liquid locomotion,” as used herein, refers to nematodes exhibiting movement, such as swimming behavior, when placed into a liquid.	By a “neuron” is meant a cell of ectodermal embryonic origin derived from any part of the nervous system of an animal. Neurons express well-characterized neuron-specific markers that include neurofilament proteins, MAP2, and class III-tubulin. Included as neurons are, for example, hippocampal, cortical, motor, sensory, sympathetic, septal cholinergic, and cerebellar neurons.	By a “condition” is meant a state of being or feeling. Conditions include, but are not limited to, loss of appetite, gain of appetite, insomnia, inability to wake up, memory loss, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal cramps, ability or inability to learn, body temperature deregulation, moods, such as depression or mania, panic disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, migraine, abnormal sexual or hallucinogenic behavior, abnormal cardiovascular function, abnormal muscle contraction, and abnormal endocrine regulation.	By a “secondary target” is meant any additional site of biological activity acted upon by a compound that is different than the site of biological activity for which the compound is administered. As used herein, a compound that acts upon a secondary target may result in the compound having non-therapeutic side effects. For example, a drug administered as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, such as fluoxetine, may affect serotonin reuptake transporter-dependent and serotonin reuptake transporter-independent pathways. In this example, the affected serotonin reuptake transporter-independent pathways are “secondary targets.”	By “transgenic” is meant any cell or organism that includes a DNA sequence that is inserted by artifice into a cell and becomes part of the genome of the organism that develops from that cell. As used herein, the transgenic organism is generally a transgenic non-human mammal (e.g., a rodent, such a rat or mouse) or invertebrate (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans), and the DNA (transgene) is inserted by artifice into the genome.	By “expose” is meant to allow contact between an animal, cell, lysate or extract derived from a cell, or molecule derived from a cell, and a test compound or activator of a serotonergic response.	By a “post-translational modification” is meant any change to a polypeptide during or after synthesis. Such modifications may include phosphorylation and glycosylation. Post-translational modifications may be naturally occurring (such as during synthesis within a cell), or artificially generated (such as by recombinant or chemical means).	BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS	FIG. 1 shows that the NSMs of mod-5 mutants are defective in serotonin uptake. Panel A shows wild-type and mod-5(n822) animals preincubated with exogenous serotonin stained using FIF to visualize serotonin (Sulston et al., J Comp Neurol 163: 215-226, 1975). The arrow points to a NSM cell body. The arrowheads point to NSM axonal processes. No NSM cell bodies were FIF-positive in mod-5(n822) mutants. Panel B shows NSMs in mod-S(n822) and mod-5(n823) mutants with reduced uptake of exogenous serotonin. At least 100 animals were tested for each genotype in each condition. Error bars indicate the standard error of the sample mean (SEM).	FIG. 2 shows the phenotypic characterization and cloning of mod-5. Panel A indicates that mod-5 mutants exhibited a hyperenhanced slowing response. Data from well-fed (black bars) and food-deprived (gray bars) animals are shown. Panel B shows that the hyperenhanced slowing response exhibited by mod-5(n823) mutants was suppressed by ablation of the NSMs. Panel C indicates that the decrease in endogenous serotonin partially suppressed the mod-5 phenotype. mod-5(n823); cat-4 double mutants displayed an enhanced slowing response intermediate to that of mod-5(n823) (see FIG. 2A) and cat-4 mutants. Panel D shows that mod-5 mutants were hypersensitive to exogenous serotonin. In panels A-D, the error bars indicate the standard error of the sample mean and the asterisks indicate a p<0.0001 calculated using the Student's t-test.	FIG. 3 shows that mod-5 encodes a protein similar to the human and Drosophila melanogaster serotonin reuptake transporters. The top of panel A is a genetic map of the mod-5 region of linkage group I (LG I) and the bottom of panel A shows the intron-exon structure of mod-5(Y54E10A—154.A), inferred from cDNA sequences. The open boxes indicate coding regions, the lines indicate untranslated regions, the arrow shows the direction of transcription, and SL1 indicates the SL1 trans-spliced leader. Panel B shows an amino-acid sequence alignment of MOD-5 CeSERT (SEQ ID NO:5) with human SERT (hSERT) (SEQ ID NO:10) and Drosophila melanogaster SERT (dSERT) (SEQ ID NO:11). The 12 predicted transmembrane regions are underlined. Amino acids conserved between MOD-5 and at least one of the two other proteins are shown in black boxes, and the two mod-5 point mutations are indicated. mod-5(n822) is a T-to-A transversion mutation resulting in a C225opal nonsense substitution, and mod-5(n823) is a C-to-T transition mutation resulting in a P569S missense substitution. The “▾” indicates potential PKA or PKC phosphorylation sites. The “” indicates potential N-linked glycosylation sites (consensus N-x-S/T). The “♦” indicates the aspartate residue conserved in SERTs, NETs (norepinephrine transporters), and DATs (dopamine transporters).	FIG. 4 shows the physiological characterization of MOD-5 CeSERT. Panel A shows the time dependence of MOD-5 CeSERT-mediated [3H]serotonin transport. GFPMOD-5 (circles) and the GFP vector (squares) are shown. Panel B shows the dependence of MOD-5 CeSERT-mediated [3H]serotonin transport on Na+ and Cl− ions in the external buffer. Panel C shows MOD-5 CeSERT-mediated [3H]serotonin transport as a function of serotonin concentration. The insert is an Eadie-Hoftsee transformation (Stryer, Biochemistry, 4th Edition. New York: W.H. Freeman, 1995) of the data where Km=150±8 nM; Vmax=8.31×10−9 nmoles per cell per min. Panel D shows that MOD-5 CeSERT-mediated transport was specific for [3H]serotonin. Panel E shows antagonism of MOD-5 CeSERT-mediated serotonin uptake by showing inhibition curves for SSRIs and other transporter inhibitors. The extent of [3H]serotonin uptake is plotted as the percentage of [3H]serotonin uptake observed in the absence of antagonists vs. log [inhibitor]. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.	FIG. 5 shows mod-5 genetic interactions and serotonin- and MOD-5 CeSERT-dependence of the potentiating effect of fluoxetine. In Panel A the gray bars show the enhanced slowing response of mod-1, goa-1, mod-5 goa-1, goa-1; mod-1, mod-5; mod-1, and mod-5 goa-1; mod-1 mutants. The hatched bars show the effect of fluoxetine on the enhanced slowing response of wild-type animals (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000) and mod-1 and mod-S; mod-1 mutants. Panel B shows rescue by serotonin preincubation of the resistance of bas-1; cat-4 mutants to the potentiating effect of fluoxetine on the enhanced slowing response. Panel C shows that mod-5(n3314) mutants retained normal sensitivity to fluoxetine-mediated paralysis. In panels A-C, error bars indicate the standard error of the sample mean and the asterisks indicate a p<0.0001 calculated using the Student's t-test.	FIG. 6 shows the serotonin- and MOD-5 CeSERT-independence of fluoxetine-induced egg-laying. Fluoxetine-induced egg-laying (n=50 for each genotype) is represented by a bar graph in panel A for wild-type animals, in panel B for mod-5(n3314) mutants, in panel C for tph-1 mutants, in panel D for cat-4 mutants, and in panel E for egl-1 mutants.	FIG. 7 shows that mod-5(n3314) mutants, but not tph-1 mutants, are hypersensitive to stimulation of egg-laying by serotonin. Serotonin-induced stimulation of egg-laying (n=50 for each genotype) is represented by a bar graph in panel A for wild-type animals, in panel B for mod-5(n3314) mutants, and in panel C for tph-1 mutants.	FIG. 8 shows non-limiting models for the effects of fluoxetine on C. elegans behaviors. Panel A shows that MOD-5 CeSERT acts upstream of the MOD-1 serotonin-gated chloride channel and the GOA-1 G-protein. Panel B diagrams the potentiating effect of low concentrations of fluoxetine on the enhanced slowing response is serotonin- and MOD-5 CeSERT-dependent. 5-HTR is a metabotropic serotonin receptor that GOA-1 may couple to. The “” represents serotonin and the “●” represents chloride ions. Panel C shows that the effects of high concentrations of fluoxetine on egg-laying, nose contraction and paralysis are MOD-5 CeSERT-independent. High concentrations of fluoxetine act on non-SERT targets and on a non-serotonin pathway to paralyze C. elegans and to lead to the contraction of nose muscles. By contrast, stimulation of egg-laying by fluoxetine is MOD-5 CeSERT-independent but still partially dependent on serotonin.	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION	Described herein are substantially purified nucleic acid sequences encoding a CeSERT polypeptide or a mutant CeSERT polypeptide, as well as the polypeptides themselves. In addition, methods for identifying modulators of the biological activity of a serotonin reuptake transporter, and identifying if such a modulator has a secondary target are also described below, as are methods for treating a condition in a subject.	The cloning of the CeSERT gene is an important advancement. Since serotonergic neurotransmission is likely to be conserved in C. elegans relative to other animals, including Drosophila melanogaster and mammals, understanding the function of CeSERT, in the context of the various C. elegans behaviors that are modulated by serotonin, allows a molecular/genetic pathway for serotonergic neurotransmission to be defined. In addition, the cloning of the CeSERT gene, and mutations thereof, described herein is useful in identifying residues and regions of importance for both SERT function and for the response of a SERT to a specific drug.	Furthermore, the C. elegans strains with mutant CeSERT genes of the present invention can be used as tools for fast and easy, high-throughput screening of compounds that modulate SERTs, and secondary targets or side effects of compounds that modulate SERTs, including currently available drugs, as is described below.	Isolation of Mutants Defective in Serotonin Uptake	Formaldehyde-induced fluorescence (FIF) histochemistry indicates that the C. elegans neurosecretory motor neurons (NSMs), located in the pharynx, contain serotonin in their cell bodies and axonal processes (Horvitz et al., Science 216: 1012-1014, 1982). FIF in the NSMs was more readily observed when animals were preincubated with exogenous serotonin prior to the staining protocol (Horvitz et al., Science 216: 1012-1014, 1982). This observation suggested that the NSMs possess an active uptake system that can concentrate serotonin from the extracellular environment.	We performed a genetic screen for mutants lacking FIF in the NSMs following preincubation with exogenous serotonin. Two mutations that failed to complement each other, n822 and n823, were isolated. n822 and n823 mutants lacked FIF in the NSM cell bodies after serotonin preincubation but retained FIF in the NSM axonal processes (FIG. 1A). Nomarski optics (Ellis and Horvitz, Cell 44: 817-829, 1986) revealed that these mutants had NSM cell bodies in their usual positions.	Serotonin can also be, detected in C. elegans using anti-serotonin antisera, which have proven to be more sensitive than FIF and have allowed the reliable detection of endogenous serotonin in the NSMs and other neurons without requiring preincubation with exogenous serotonin (Desai et al., Nature 336: 638-646, 1988; Loer and Kenyon, J Neurosci 13: 5407-5417, 1993; Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000). We used anti-serotonin antisera to evaluate serotonin reuptake in n822 and n823 mutants. Since endogenous serotonin masks serotonin reuptake in NSMs visualized using anti-serotonin antisera, we used a cat-4(e1141) (catecholamine defective) genetic background to reduce endogenous serotonin levels (Desai et al., Nature 336: 638-646, 1988; Weinshenker et al., Neurosci 15: 6975-6985, 1995). cat-4 encodes GTP cyclohydrolase I, which is required for the synthesis of a biopterin co-factor needed for dopamine and serotonin biosynthesis (Kapatos et al., J Neurochem 72: 669-675, 1999).	We counted the number of immunoreactive NSMs in cat-4 single and n822; cat-4 and n823; cat-4 double mutants with or without exogenous serotonin preincubation. While NSMs in the cat-4 mutants were capable of serotonin uptake, the NSMs in n822; cat-4 and n823; cat-4 double mutants were partially defective in serotonin uptake (FIG. 1B), confirming our FIF observations. For example, we observed no brightly-fluorescing NSMs in n823; cat-4 mutants preincubated with serotonin, while 43% of the NSMs in cat-4 mutants had bright immunofluorescence (FIG. 1B, black bars). That a slight increase in NSM immunoreactivity was observed in n822; cat-4 and n823; cat-4 mutants upon serotonin preincubation indicates that the n822 and n823 mutations do not lead to a complete loss of serotonin uptake. While previous studies did not detect anti-serotonin immunoreactivity in cat-4 mutants (Desai et al., Nature 336: 638-646, 1988; Loer and Kenyon, J Neurosci 13: 5407-5417, 1993; Weinshenker et al., J Neurosci 15: 6975-6985, 1995), we observed, using the same staining protocol as in the previous studies, a small percentage of weakly anti-serotonin-immunoreactive NSMs in cat-4 mutants in the absence of serotonin preincubation (FIG. 1B). This staining is serotonin, since this antibody did not result in any immunoreactivity in tph-1 mutants (see below), which lack the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase and are specifically deficient in serotonin (Sze et al., Nature 403: 561-564, 2000). Our data show that the cat-4 mutation does not lead to a complete loss of serotonin, consistent with the conclusions of Desai et al. (Nature 336: 638-646, 1988) and Avery and Horvitz (J Exp. Zool 253: 263-270, 1990).	MOD-5 is Similar to SERTs	The C. elegans CeSERT(n823) mutation had previously been mapped to the interval between lin-17 and unc-74 on chromosome I (Sawin, Ph.D. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1996). mod-5 was mapped further to the genetic interval between lin-17 and unc-11. Transformed rescue of mod-5(n823) was achieved by injecting fragments of genomic DNA, generated by long-PCR, that contained the CeSERT predicted open reading frame. This open reading frame was then sequenced in the mod-5(n822) and mod-5(n823) animals and found to contain point mutations. Subsequently, animals containing the n3314 deletion were isolated and the n3314 allele was shown not to complement the n822 and n823 alleles, thus confirming the cloning of the mod-5 gene.	We used the serotonin hypersensitivity of mod-5 mutants in the liquid swimming assay to map and clone the gene. We mapped mod-5 to an approximately 2.0 map unit interval on chromosome I, between fog-1 and unc-11 (FIG. 3A) (see Example 6). An open reading frame, Y54E10A—154.A, in this region was predicted to encode a protein with similarity to serotonin reuptake transporters (SERTs).	We generated an eight kilobase (kb) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product from the genomic region spanning the first eight exons of Y54E10A—154.A (FIG. 3A) and encoding the first 507 amino acids of the corresponding predicted protein. This construct robustly rescued the serotonin hypersensitivity phenotype of mod-5(n823) mutants in 16 of 20 transgenic lines tested. We obtained a partial cDNA clone of Y54E10A—154.A using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and determined the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA using 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), respectively. The 5′ end of the cDNA contained an SL1 trans-spliced leader, which is found at the 5′ ends of many C. elegans transcripts (Krause and Hirsh, Cell 49: 753-761, 1987). The 3′ end contained a poly-A stretch, indicating that we had determined the complete Y54E10A—154.A transcriptional unit (FIG. 3A). This cDNA was capable of rescuing the serotonin hypersensitivity of mod-5 mutants (see below).	Protein sequence comparisons revealed that the predicted protein encoded by our full-length cDNA is 44% identical to human SERT (hSERT; Ramamoorthy et al., 1993) and 45% identical to the other known invertebrate SERT, from Drosophila melanogaster (dSERT; Corey et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91: 1188-1192, 1994), which is itself 51% identical to hSERT (FIG. 3B). We identified single-base mutations in the Y54E10A—154.A coding sequence in mod-5(n822) and mod-5(n823) mutants (FIG. 3B). The mutation in mod-5(n822) is predicted to change cysteine 225 (codon TGT) to an opal stop codon (TGA). The mutation in mod-5(n823) is predicted to change proline 569 (CCG) to serine (TCG) within a transmembrane region. We concluded that Y54E10A—154.A is mod-5.	Like SERTs from other species (Barker and Blakely, Methods Enzymol 296: 475-498, 1998), the MOD-5 protein is predicted to contain 12 putative transmembrane regions (FIG. 3B). Much of the sequence conservation is clustered in or around these transmembrane regions, suggesting that the membrane topology of the SERTs is important for their function. At position 119 of SEQ ID NO:5 (FIG. 3B, diamond), within the first predicted transmembrane domain, MOD-5 has an aspartate residue that is conserved in serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake transporters but not in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake transporters (Barker and Blakely, Methods Enzymol 296: 475-498, 1998). This aspartate may be involved in binding to the amino group in serotonin, dopamine, and NE (Kitayama et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89: 7782-7785, 1992). MOD-5 also has other similarities to hSERT and dSERT (FIG. 3B legend).	Both wild-type and mutant CeSERT cDNAs have been obtained and the cDNA sequences of wild-type CeSERT (SEQ ID NO:1), CeSERT(n822) (SEQ ID NO:2), CeSERT (n823) (SEQ ID NO:3), and CeSERT(n3314) (SEQ ID NO:4) as well as the amino acid sequences encoded by wild-type CeSERT (SEQ ID NO:5), CeSERT(n822) (SEQ ID NO:6), CeSERT (n823) (SEQ ID NO:7), and CeSERT(n3314) (SEQ ID NO:8) were identified.	mod-5(n3314) is a Null Allele	To determine the phenotypic consequence of completely eliminating mod-5 function, we screened libraries of mutagenized animals using PCR to identify large deletions (Jansen et al., Nat Genet 17: 119-121, 1997) in the mod-5 genomic locus. We isolated a deletion allele, n3314 that contains a 1688 base pair (bp) deletion in the mod-5 genomic locus (FIG. 3A). The altered open reading frame (ORF) is predicted to encode the first 42 amino acids of MOD-5 and, if the end of exon 2 splices onto the next available splice-acceptor site at the start of exon 8, an additional 18 out-of-frame amino acids before ending at a premature stop codon.	n3314 displayed and failed to complement mod-5(n822) and mod-5(n823) for both the hyperenhanced slowing response and serotonin hypersensitivity in the liquid swimming assay, confirming that n3314 is an allele of mod-5. mod-5(n3314) mutants were more hypersensitive to serotonin than were mod-5(n822) and mod-5(n823) mutants (FIG. 2D). mod-5(n3314) mutants also exhibited a more severe hyperenhanced slowing response than did the nonsense mod-5(n822) and the missense mod-S(n823) mutants (FIG. 2A). On Petri plates without bacteria, the locomotory rate of mod-5(n3314) mutants was not different from that of the wild-type (FIG. 2A).	Well-fed mod-5(n3314) mutants showed no defect in their basal slowing response to bacteria (FIG. 2A). Given the stronger behavioral defects of mod-5(n3314) mutants and the molecular nature of the n3314 deletion, we believe that n3314 is a null allele of mod-5 and that both mod-5(n822) and mod-5(n823) are partial loss-of-function alleles. mod-5(n822), which is predicted to encode only the first 224 amino acids of MOD-5, is not a null allele, based on comparisons of the phenotypes of mod-5(n822), mod-5(n3314), and mod-5(n822)/mod-5(n3314) trans-heterozygous animals (FIGS. 2A and D). This activity of mod-5(n822) might be a consequence of the presence of functional mod-5 transcripts produced by alternative splicing or read-through of the stop codon. Alternatively, it is conceivable that the first 224 amino acids of MOD-5 retain partial SERT function. This latter possibility is consistent with our rescue of the serotonin hypersensitivity of mod-5(n823) mutants with a construct that encodes only the first 507 amino acids of MOD-5, suggesting that all 671 amino acids of MOD-5 are not essential for at least some aspects of SERT function.	Since we had isolated the mod-5 cDNA using RT-PCR and RACE, we sought to confirm that the protein encoded by this cDNA could function in vivo. We constructed a mini-gene in which the mod-5 cDNA was placed under the control of 2.7 kb of genomic DNA upstream to the first predicted methionine of mod-5. mod-5(n3314) animals transgenic for extrachromosomal arrays consisting of this mini-gene construct were no longer serotonin hypersensitive, confirming that we had defined a functional mod-5 gene and that the mod-5 cDNA could encode a functional SERT and was suitable for serotonin-uptake assays in a heterologous system (see below).	Test for CeSERT Association with Locomotion in C. elegans	C. elegans, for example hemaphrodites, respond to the presence of a bacterial lawn (their food source) by slowing their rate of locomotion. Animals deprived of bacteria for 30 minutes exhibit enhanced slowing when they encounter a bacterial lawn. Genetic, pharmacological, and laser ablation studies demonstrate that this modulatory response is mediated, in part, by serotonin.	Since n822 and n823 mutants were defective in serotonin uptake, we sought to determine if these mutants were abnormal in their responses to endogenous serotonin release. We tested the serotonin-dependent enhanced slowing response (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000) of these mutants. Whereas well-fed wild-type animals slow their locomotory rate slightly in response to bacteria (the basal slowing response) food-deprived wild-type animals display a greater degree of slowing of locomotory rate in response to bacteria (the enhanced slowing response) (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000; and FIG. 2A). Strikingly, n822 and n823 mutants exhibited a hyperenhanced slowing response. On Petri plates with bacteria, the locomotory rates of food-deprived n822 and n823 mutants slowed significantly more than did those of food-deprived wild-type animals (FIG. 2A, gray bars). In contrast, on Petri plates without bacteria, the locomotory rates of food-deprived n822 and n823 mutants were not significantly different from those of food-deprived wild-type animals (FIG. 2A, gray bars). Well-fed n822 and n823 mutants exhibited no defect in the serotonin-independent dopamine-dependent basal slowing response to bacteria (FIG. 2A, black bars) (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000). Genes involved in the enhanced slowing response are called mod (modulation of locomotion defective) (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000), and we named the gene defined by the allelic mutations n822 and n823 mod-5. The hyperenhanced slowing responses of these mod-5 mutants were presumably a consequence of a defect in the clearing of serotonin from the relevant synapses by uptake into serotonergic neurons, thereby leading to increased serotonin signaling and a greater inhibition of locomotion.	Ablation of the Serotonergic NSMs or a Decrease in Endogenous Serotonin Suppresses mod-S Mutations	Ablation of the serotonergic NSMs with a laser microbeam leads to a defect in the enhanced slowing response (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000). Since the NSMs were defective in serotonin uptake in mod-5 mutants (see above), we tested whether ablation of the NSMs affected the hyperenhanced slowing response of mod-5 mutants. On Petri plates with bacteria, food-deprived NSM-ablated mod-5(n823) mutants exhibited an enhanced slowing response that was significantly reduced in comparison to that of food-deprived mock-ablated mod-5(n823) mutants (FIG. 2B, gray bars). Well-fed NSM-ablated mod-5(n823) mutants were not significantly affected in their basal slowing response to bacteria (FIG. 2B, black bars). Ablation of the 15 neuron, another pharyngeal neuron, had no effect on the enhanced slowing response of mod-5 mutants, indicating that the effect of the NSM-ablations was not a consequence of the ablation protocol per se.	
US20050166270_0004	We reasoned that the ablation of the NSMs probably led to a loss of serotonin needed for the hyperenhanced slowing exhibited by mod-S mutants. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether cat-4 mutants, which have decreased serotonin levels (see above), could suppress the mod-5 phenotype. cat-4 mutants are defective in the enhanced slowing response (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000; and FIG. 2C), and the reduced serotonin in these mutants is the cause of this defect (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000).	On Petri plates with bacteria, the locomotory rate of food-deprived mod-5(n823); cat-4 double mutants was significantly faster than that of food-deprived mod-5(n823) mutants (compare FIG. 2C to FIG. 2A gray bars), but similar to that of NSM-ablated mod-5(n823) mutants (FIG. 2B), suggesting that for the enhanced slowing response the ablation of the NSMs is equivalent to a reduction in serotonin levels in the animal. That the locomotory rate of food-deprived mod-5(n823); cat-4 double mutants was significantly slower than that of cat-4 mutants (FIG. 2C) is likely a consequence of the effect of residual serotonin in cat-4 mutants (FIG. 1B).	Exogenous serotonin inhibits wild-type C. elegans locomotion (Horvitz et al., Science 216: 1012-1014, 1982). To determine if mod-5(n822) and mod-5(n823) mutants were abnormal in their response to exogenous serotonin, we used a liquid swimming assay (Ranganathan et al., Nature 408: 470-475, 2000). In this assay, mod-5(n822) and mod-5(n823) mutants were hypersensitive to exogenously added serotonin (FIG. 2D), presumably because this serotonin was not efficiently cleared from the relevant synapses.	MOD-5 Functions as a SERT in Mammalian Cells	Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer (see Example 6), we generated human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lines that stably expressed MOD-5. Using these cell lines, we performed uptake assays similar to those previously done for other SERTs (Ramamoorthy et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 2542-2546, 1993; Demchyshyn et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91: 5158-5162, 1994). The uptake of [3H]serotonin by MOD-5-expressing cell lines was saturable, indicating that the accumulation of [3H]serotonin in the cells was facilitated by MOD-5 (FIG. 4A). MOD-5-mediated [3H]serotonin transport was strictly dependent on Na+ ions (FIG. 4B), as has been observed for serotonin transport by hSERT (Ramamoorthy et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 2542-2546, 1993), rat SERT (rSERT; Blakely et al., Nature 354: 66-70, 1991; Hoffman et al., Science 254: 579-580, 1991), and dSERT (Demchyshyn et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91: 5158-5162, 1994). By contrast, MOD-5 did not display a strict dependence on Cl− ions (FIG. 4B), whereas both hSERT and rSERT, but not dSERT, do display such strict dependence (Blakely et al., Nature 354: 66-70, 1991; Hoffman et al., Science 254: 579-580, 1991; Ramamoorthy et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 2542-2546, 1993; Demchyshyn et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91: 5158-5162, 1994).	MOD-5-mediated [3H]serotonin transport occurred in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner (FIG. 4C), with a Km=150±8 nM, a value similar to those reported for other SERTs (Km range=280-630 nM) (Blakely et al., Nature 354: 66-70, 1991; Hoffman et al., Science 254: 579-580, 1991; Ramamoorthy et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 2542-2546, 1993; Corey et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91: 1188-1192, 1994; Demchyshyn et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91: 5158-5162, 1994; Chang et al., Biochem Pharmacol 22: 3099-3108, 1996; Padbury et al., Brain Res Mol Brain Res 45: 163-168, 1997; Chen et al., Am J Physiol 275: G433-448, 1998; Mortensen et al., Brain Res Mol Brain Res 71: 120-126, 1999).	We tested the specificity of MOD-5 by assaying the ability of MOD-5 to transport various radiolabeled neurotransmitters besides serotonin. MOD-5-mediated uptake was highly specific for [3H]serotonin and inefficient at translocating radiolabeled GABA, glutamate, glycine, NE, histamine, and dopamine (FIG. 4D). We also tested the ability of these neurotransmitters to inhibit [3H]serotonin uptake via MOD-5. None of the six neurotransmitters tested, even when present at 100 μM, substantially inhibited the uptake of 50 nM serotonin. We also tested whether octopamine or tyramine, two invertebrate-specific neurotransmitters, could inhibit [3H]serotonin transport; we could not test MOD-5-mediated uptake of these neurotransmitters, as radiolabeled octopamine and tyramine are not available. Tyramine (100 μM) partially inhibited (54%+10% of control) the transport of [3H]serotonin (50 nM) by MOD-5; octopamine (100 μM) did not inhibit (86%+12% of control) MOD-5-mediated [3H]serotonin (50 nM) transport. By comparison, dSERT-mediated transport of 100 nM [3H]serotonin was reduced to 95%+15% of control by 200 μM tyramine and to 82%+15% of control by 200 μM octopamine (Corey et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91: 1188-1192, 1994). These data suggested that there are subtle differences in the properties of MOD-5 and dSERT.	We tested whether MOD-5-mediated [3H]serotonin transport was inhibited by tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, and non-specific monoamine transporter inhibitors (Blakely et al., Nature 354: 66-70, 1991; Ramamoorthy et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 2542-2546, 1993; Demchyshyn et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91: 5158-5162, 1994). The rank order of potency for inhibition of MOD-5-mediated [3H]serotonin transport was imipramine (Ki=89±58 nM)≈fluoxetine (Ki=133±90 nM)≈paroxetine (Ki=179±64 nM)>desipramine (Ki=334±115 nM)>citalopram (Ki=994±298 nM)>>cocaine (Ki=4076±349 nM) (FIG. 4E). This rank order is different from that of other SERTs (for example, the rank order of potency for inhibition of hSERT-mediated [3H]serotonin transport is paroxetine>fluoxetine>imipramine=citalopram>>cocaine; Ramamoorthy et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 2542-2546, 1993), and for some of the inhibitors the Ki values were higher than those reported for the other SERTs (Blakely et al., Nature 354: 66-701991; Hoffman et al., Science 254: 579-580, 1991; Ramamoorthy et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 2542-2546, 1993; Corey et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91: 1188-1192, 1994; Demchyshyn et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91: 5158-5162, 1994; Chang et al., Brain Res Mol Brain Res 43: 185-192, 1996; Padbury et al., Brain Res Mol Brain Res 45: 163-168, 1997; Chen et al., Am J Physiol 275: G433-448, 1998; Mortensen et al., Brain Res Mol Brain Res 71: 120-126, 1999).	Taken together, the specificity of MOD-5-mediated transport for serotonin, the dependence of such transport on Na+ and Cl− ions, and the inhibition of serotonin transport by SSRIs establish that MOD-5 is a C. elegans SERT (CeSERT).	MOD-5 is Likely the Only SERT in C. elegans	To determine if MOD-5 is the only SERT in C. elegans, we analyzed the C. elegans genomic sequence for other potentials SERTs and performed in vivo assays of serotonin uptake in mod-5 mutants. We found 15 Na+/Cl− dependent neurotransmitter transporter-like predicted ORFs in the completed C. elegans genomic sequence (The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, 1998). Only two of these ORFs, T23G5.5 and T03F7.1, are nearly as similar (43% and 41% identity, respectively) to hSERT as is MOD-5 CeSERT, and only MOD-5 CeSERT and T23G5.5 have an aspartate corresponding to aspartate 119 in MOD-5 CeSERT (SEQ ID NO:5), a conserved residue likely to be functionally important for amine transport (see above). T23G5.5 is a dopamine reuptake transporter and is very inefficient at transporting serotonin (Jayanthi et al., Mol Pharmacol 54: 601-609, 1998). Accordingly, from sequence analysis, it is likely that MOD-5 CeSERT is the only SERT in C. elegans. Other species that have been analyzed also contain only one SERT gene.	To determine if a second SERT exists in C. elegans, we tested whether serotonergic neurons in mod-5(n3314) mutants are be able to take up exogenously added serotonin and whether non-serotonergic cells possess a SERT activity, using anti-serotonin antisera to detect the uptake of serotonin. We used the tph-1(mg280) mutant, which contains a deletion in the tryptophan hydroxylase gene and is therefore defective in an enzyme essential for serotonin biosynthesis to eliminate endogenous serotonin (Sze et al., Nature 403: 561-564, 2000). tph-1 mutants completely lack anti-serotonin immunofluorescence (Sze et al., Nature 403: 561-564, 2000). We have confirmed these findings (Table 1) using the sane anti-serotonin antibodies used in FIG. 1B. tph-1 mutants are unlikely to be perturbed in the levels of other biogenic amines since tryptophan hydroxylase only functions in serotonin biosynthesis (Cooper et al., The Biochemical Basis of Neuropharmacology, 7th Edition. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996; Sze et al., Nature 403: 561-564, 2000).

In pretreatment 2, animals from plates with no drug in pretreatment 1 were transferred to plates containing no drug or 2 mM serotonin, and animals from plates with fluoxetine were transferred to plates containing 2 mM serotonin and the same specified concentration of fluoxetine as in pretreatment 1. After 2 hours, animals were fixed and stained with anti-serotonin	# antisera. N/A stands for not applicable. At least 100 animals were assayed in each condition for each genotype; >200 mod-5; tph-1 animals pretreated with serotonin in pretreatment 2 were scored. The tph-1 (mg 280) and mod-5 (n3314) alleles were used.	To identify cells capable of serotonin uptake, we examined the head, ventral cord, gut, and tail of tph-1 mutants pretreated with serotonin and observed serotonin immunofluorescence in only the serotonergic neurons (see below). To examine the requirement of MOD-5 CeSERT for serotonin uptake by serotonergic neurons, we scored the NSMs for serotonin uptake, since these neurons are the most brightly staining serotonergic neurons in the animal following incubation with exogenous serotonin. Without serotonin pretreatment, both tph-1 single and mod-5(n3314); tph-1 double mutants had no NSMs that were serotonin positive (Table 1). In contrast, when pretreated with serotonin, tph-1 mutants displayed robust serotonin staining in the NSMs, while mod-5(n3314); tph-1 double mutants showed none (Table 1). We observed similar results for the serotonergic ADF neurons in the head and for the hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) in the mid-body. Thus, no other transporter is likely to transport serotonin into serotonergic neurons in the absence of the MOD-5 CeSERT. We also examined the head, ventral cord, gut, and tail of mod-5(n3314); tph-1 double mutants pretreated with serotonin and observed no serotonin immunofluorescence anywhere in the animal, indicating that no other cells display serotonin uptake activity in the absence of MOD-5 CeSERT.	These serotonin uptake experiments taken together with the analysis of the C. elegans genomic sequence indicate that MOD-5 is likely to be the only SERT in C. elegans.	mod-5 Interacts Genetically with mod-1 and goa-1	Mutants defective in the serotonin-mediated enhanced slowing response defined several mod genes (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000). One of these genes, mod-1, encodes a novel ionotropic serotonin receptor, a serotonin-gated chloride channel (Ranganathan et al., 2000). On Petri plates with bacteria, the locomotory rate of food-deprived mod-1 mutants is substantially faster than that of the wild-type (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000; Ranganathan et al., Nature 408: 470-475, 2000; also FIG. 5A, gray bars). In comparison, mod-5 mutants exhibit a hyperenhanced slowing response (FIG. 5A).	To define the genetic pathway in which mod-1 and mod-5 act in the enhanced slowing response, we characterized mod-5(n3314); mod-1(ok103) double mutants. mod-1(ok103) is a null allele by genetic and molecular criteria (Ranganathan et al., 2000). If the function of the MOD-1 serotonin receptor were essential for the effects of serotonin not cleared from synapses in mod-5 mutants, then eliminating mod-5 function should have had no effect in a mutant that lacked mod-1 function, i.e., mod-S(n3314); mod-1(ok103) double mutants should exhibit the same phenotype as mod-1(ok103) single mutants. However, the enhanced slowing response of mod-5(n3314); mod-1(ok103) double mutants was intermediate to the responses of mod-1(ok103) and mod-5(n3314) single mutants (FIG. 5A, gray bars). At least five trials were performed for each genotype. This observation indicates that the serotonin signaling triggered by bacteria in the enhanced slowing response acts via at least two parallel serotonin signaling pathways, a MOD-1-dependent pathway and a MOD-1-independent pathway. This observation is also consistent with the observation that mod-1(ok103) single mutants were not completely defective in the enhanced slowing response (FIG. 5A).	Animals carrying mutations in the G-protein gene goa-1(Gαo, G-protein 0, alpha subunit) (Mendel et al., Science 267: 1652-1655, 1995; Segalat et al., Science 267: 1648-1651, 1995) are also defective in the enhanced slowing response (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000; also FIG. 5A). Since GOA-1 animals are resistant to serotonin in assays of locomotion (Segalat et al., Science 267: 1648-1651, 1995; and our observations), pharyngeal pumping (Segalat et al., Science 267: 1648-1651, 1995), and egg-laying (Mendel et al., Science 267: 1652-1655, 1995; Segalat et al., Science 267: 1648-1651, 1995), we tested whether the MOD-1-independent pathway might involve goa-1. As with mod-5; mod-1 double mutants, the enhanced slowing response of mod-5(n3314) goa-1(n1134) double mutants was intermediate to the responses of mod-5(n3314) and goa-1(n1134) single mutants (FIG. 5A, gray bars), indicating that serotonin signaling triggered by bacteria in the enhanced slowing response does not act solely through goa-1. In comparison, food-deprived mod-5(n3314) goa-1(n1134); mod-1(ok103) triple mutants exhibited very little slowing in response to bacteria (FIG. 5A). These observations suggested that MOD-1 and GOA-1 act in two parallel pathways that together mediate the response to the excess serotonin signaling in mod-5(n3314) mutants.	Fluoxetine Blocks Serotonin Uptake in vivo	Since fluoxetine blocked [3H]serotonin transport in mammalian cells expressing MOD-5 CeSERT (see above), we tested whether fluoxetine could block serotonin uptake in vivo in C. elegans (Table 1). We pretreated tph-1 mutants with fluoxetine, incubated the animals with serotonin, and scored the number of serotonin-positive NSMs. We observed, for example, few serotonin-positive NSMs when tph-1 mutants were pretreated with 0.22 mM fluoxetine (Table 1), a concentration sufficient to potentiate the enhanced slowing response (see below). Furthermore, tph-1 mutants pretreated with as little as 0.44 mM fluoxetine, a concentration lower than that required for all the MOD-5 CeSERT-independent effects of fluoxetine (see below), were as defective in serotonin uptake as were untreated mod-5(n3314); tph-1 double mutants (Table 1). These observations indicate that fluoxetine may block serotonin uptake in C. elegans in vivo and may do so by inhibiting MOD-5 CeSERT.	The Potentiation of the Enhanced Slowing Response by Fluoxetine Requires mod-5 CeSERT and Serotonin	When wild-type animals that have been food-deprived in the presence of 0.22 mM fluoxetine encounter bacteria, they slow their locomotory rate more than if they had been food-deprived in the absence of fluoxetine (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000; see FIG. 5A). This fluoxetine-mediated potentiation of the enhanced slowing response resembles the hyperenhanced slowing response exhibited by mod-5(n3314) mutants (FIG. 5A), suggesting that fluoxetine causes this potentiation by blocking MOD-5 CeSERT function. Accordingly, mod-5(n3314) mutants should be resistant to the potentiating effect of fluoxetine on the enhanced slowing response. Since food-deprived mod-5(n3314) mutants exhibit an extreme hyperenhanced slowing response that cannot be further potentiated by fluoxetine treatment (FIG. 5A), we used mod-5(n3314); mod-1(ok103) double mutants to test this hypothesis. These double mutants are partially suppressed for the hyperenhanced slowing response exhibited by mod-5(n3314) animals (FIG. 5A, gray bars), and therefore a potentiation of the enhanced slowing response could be observed.	
US20050166270_0005	The enhanced slowing response of mod-1(ok103) mutants was potentiated by fluoxetine (FIG. 5A, hatched bars), indicating that fluoxetine can potentiate the enhanced slowing response in the absence of MOD-1 serotonin receptor function. This observation was consistent with the phenotype of mod-5(n3314); mod-1(ok103) double mutants in this assay, which suggested that there are MOD-1-independent serotonin pathways through which the enhanced slowing response is effected. In comparison, mod-5(n3314); mod-1(ok103) double mutants were completely resistant to the potentiating effect of fluoxetine on the enhanced slowing response (FIG. 5A, hatched bars) (At least ten trials were performed for each genotype.) Consequently, the MOD-5 CeSERT is likely the only in vivo target in C. elegans on which fluoxetine acts to potentiate the enhanced slowing response.	Since fluoxetine-mediated potentiation of the enhanced slowing response is MOD-5 CeSERT-dependent, it is also likely to be serotonin-dependent, as we previously suggested (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000), based on the observation that the enhanced slowing response in bas-1(ad446); cat-4 double mutants (bas: biogenic amine synthesis defective) is resistant to such potentiation. However, our studies of egg-laying by tph-1 mutants indicate that the resistance of cat-4 animals to the effects of high concentrations of fluoxetine likely is not caused by a deficiency in serotonin in these animals (see below). Since tph-1 mutants display sluggish locomotion, they could not be assayed for resistance to the fluoxetine-mediated potentiation of the enhanced slowing response.	We sought to determine if the serotonin-deficiency of bas-1; cat-4 double mutants renders these animals resistant to the potentiating effect of fluoxetine. The defect in the enhanced slowing response of bas-1; cat-4 double mutants in the absence of fluoxetine treatment can be rescued by preincubating the animals on Petri plates containing 2 mM serotonin (Sawin et al., 2000; and FIG. 5B), a pretreatment sufficient for the detection of serotonin in the NSMs of cat-4 (FIG. 1B) and tph-1 (Table 1) mutants. When bas-1; cat-4 mutants were preincubated with serotonin and then food-deprived in the presence of fluoxetine, they exhibited a potentiated enhanced slowing response (FIG. 5B). Consequently, restoration of serotonin to bas-1; cat-4 mutants is sufficient for fluoxetine to potentiate the enhanced slowing response of these mutants. We conclude that the effect of fluoxetine on the enhanced slowing response is dependent not only on MOD-5 CeSERT, but also on serotonin.	Fluoxetine Induces Nose Contraction and Paralysis in mod-5 and tph-1 Mutants	Treatment of C. elegans with high concentrations (0.25-1 mg/ml; 0.7-2.9 mM) of fluoxetine leads to paralysis (Choy and Thomas, Mol Cell 4: 143-152, 1999), contraction of nose muscles (Choy and Thomas, Mol Cell 4: 143-152, 1999), and stimulation of egg-laying (Weinshenker et al., Neurosci 15: 6975-6985, 1995). The concentrations of fluoxetine required for these effects are at least 2.5 fold higher than that required to detect a block of serotonin uptake in vivo (see above) and for the potentiation of the enhanced slowing response (FIG. 5B and Sawin et al., 2000). (At least five trials were performed for each genotype.)	To acertain whether the only in vivo target for fluoxetine is MOD-5 CeSERT, we tested mod-5(n3314) mutants for their responses to high concentrations of fluoxetine. mod-5(n3314) mutants retained wild-type sensitivity to fluoxetine in assays of paralysis induced by fluoxetine treatment (FIG. 5C). (Five trials with 20 animals of each genotype at each concentration and the animals were scored for paralysis after ten minutes.) There was no difference in the time-course of paralysis at any of the concentrations tested. These observations indicate that fluoxetine-induced paralysis in C. elegans is not caused by the lack of serotonin uptake from synapses. Fluoxetine-treated wild-type and mod-5(n3314) mutant animals assumed a rigid body posture. In comparison, serotonin-treated animals assumed a relaxed and flaccid body posture, suggesting that the mechanisms of locomotory inhibition by serotonin and fluoxetine are distinct. Serotonin has been proposed to decrease excitatory input to the locomotory muscles (Nurrish et al., Neuron 24: 231-242, 1999). Given the two distinct body postures, we show that fluoxetine may directly or indirectly increase excitatory input or decrease inhibitory input to the locomotory muscles.	When treated with fluoxetine for 20 minutes, a similar proportion of wild-type and mod-5(n3314) mutant animals had contracted noses (100% at 2.9 mM, and approximately 25% at 1.5 mM). Thus, the effect of fluoxetine on nose contraction also appears to act via a MOD-5 CeSERT-independent pathway. This conclusion is consistent with the conclusion by Choy and Thomas (1999) that fluoxetine-mediated nose contraction is serotonin-independent, although their hypothesis was based on studies of cat-1(e1111) mutants, which are defective in signaling by several biogenic amines (Duerr et al., J Neurosci 19: 72-84, 1999), and cat-4 mutants, which we found to not completely lack serotonin (FIG. 1B).	That the effects of high concentrations of fluoxetine on nose-contraction and paralysis were independent of MOD-5 CeSERT suggested that fluoxetine acts either on another SERT or on a distinct non-SERT target(s). As discussed above, it is likely that MOD-5 is the only SERT in C. elegans, making it also likely that a non-SERT target(s) of fluoxetine mediates the MOD-5 CeSERT-independent effects. Such non-SERT targets may or may not be part of a serotonergic signaling pathway. We explored the requirement for serotonin by testing whether fluoxetine can act in animals that lack serotonin. The serotonin-deficient mutants that have been used in numerous prior studies (e.g., Weinshenker et al., J Neurosci 15: 6975-6985, 1995; Choy and Thomas, Mol Cell 4: 143-152, 1999; Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000), such as cat-1, cat-4, and bas-1 mutants, all affect multiple biogenic amines. None of the mutants have been shown to cause a complete loss of serotonin function. We therefore tested tph-1 mutants, which appear to completely lack serotonin (see above), for their response to fluoxetine.	100% of tph-1 animals displayed contracted noses after treatment with 2.9 mM fluoxetine for 20 minutes. We found that fluoxetine treatment paralyzed tph-1 mutants to a similar extent as wild-type animals, suggesting that paralysis by high concentrations of fluoxetine is also a serotonin-independent process.	Fluoxetine Stimulates Egg-Laying in mod-5 and tph-1 Mutants	In 1.5 mM fluoxetine, mod-5(n3314) mutants were stimulated to lay eggs to nearly the same extent as was the wild-type (FIGS. 6A and B; black bars), suggesting that fluoxetine can stimulate egg-laying via one or more MOD-5 CeSERT-independent pathways. Nevertheless, mod-5(n3314) mutants were hypersensitive to exogenous serotonin in assays of egg-laying (FIGS. 7A and B), suggesting that MOD-5 CeSERT can affect serotonergic synapses that regulate egg-laying. mod-5(n3314) mutants and wild-type animals contain similar numbers of eggs (25.7±2.8 and 26.3±2.2, respectively), indicating that this hypersensitivity to exogenous serotonin was not a consequence of differences in basal egg-laying rates between wild-type animals and mod-5 mutants but rather a result of excess serotonin signaling in mod-5(n3314) mutants.	Given that the stimulation of egg-laying by fluoxetine did not require the MOD-5 CeSERT, we investigated whether this stimulation required serotonin. tph-1 mutants were partially resistant to the stimulation of egg-laying by fluoxetine (FIGS. 6A and C) indicating that serotonin mediated some but not all of the egg-laying response to fluoxetine. In contrast, cat-4 mutants were completely resistant to fluoxetine-induced egg-laying (FIGS. 6A and D), as reported by Weinshenker et al. (1995).	The reduction in egg-laying by tph-1 mutants in response to fluoxetine (FIG. 6C) is unlikely to be caused by a lower number of eggs within tph-1 mutants or the inability of egg-laying muscles in tph-1 mutants to respond to stimulatory input: tph-1 mutants contain more eggs than do wild-type animals (Sze et al., 2000) and tph-1 mutants laid about the same number of eggs in response to exogenous serotonin as did wild-type animals (FIG. 7C). That mod-5(n3314) and tph-1 mutants laid a significant numbers of eggs in response to fluoxetine argues that the mechanism(s) through which fluoxetine stimulates egg-laying in C. elegans is not only MOD-5 CeSERT-independent, but also, in part, serotonin-independent.	The serotonergic HSN motor neurons innervate the egg-laying muscles and drive egg-laying (Trent et al., Genetics 104: 619-647, 1983; Desai et al., Nature 336: 638-646, 1988). egl-1(n1084) mutants, which lack the HSNs (Desai et al., Nature 336: 638-646, 1988), released some eggs in the absence of fluoxetine (FIG. 6E, gray bars), presumably because these animals were severely bloated with eggs. However, treatment with fluoxetine had no effect on egg-laying in egl-1 mutants (FIG. 6E, black bars). These observations indicate that the HSNs are required for the stimulation of egg-laying by fluoxetine.	The present invention provides non-limiting models showing a possible pathway of MOD-5 function and showing the likely effects of fluoxetine on C. elegans behaviors (FIG. 8A-C). However, other models are not excluded from the invention.	Related CeSERT Polypeptides	In addition to the polypeptides described above, the invention includes any protein that is substantially identical to the CeSERT polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS:5-8; such homologs include other substantially pure naturally-occurring C. elegans proteins as well as allelic variants; natural mutants; induced mutants; DNA sequences that encode CeSERT proteins and also hybridize to CeSERT DNA sequences under high stringency conditions or, less preferably, under low stringency conditions (e.g., washing at 2×SSC at 40° C. with a probe length of at least 40 nucleotides); and proteins specifically bound by antisera directed to a CeSERT polypeptide. The invention also includes chimeric polypeptides that contain a portion of a CeSERT polypeptide.	Furthermore, the invention includes analogs of any of the naturally-occurring polypeptides described herein. Analogs can differ from the naturally-occurring protein by amino acid sequence differences, by post-translational modifications, or by both. Modifications include in vivo and in vitro chemical derivatization of polypeptides, e.g., acetylation, carboxylation, phosphorylation, or glycosylation; such modifications may occur during polypeptide synthesis or processing or following treatment with isolated modifying enzymes. Analogs can also differ from the naturally-occurring polypeptide by alterations in primary sequence. These include degenerate variants, both natural and induced (for example, resulting from random mutagenesis by irradiation or exposure to ethanemethylsulfate or by site-specific mutagenesis, as described in Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1989, or Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., 1994). Also included are cyclized peptides, molecules, and analogs that contain residues other than L-amino acids (e.g., D-amino acids) or non-naturally occurring or synthetic amino acids (e.g., β or γ amino acids).	In addition to full-length polypeptides, the invention also includes polypeptide fragments. Fragments of polypeptides can be generated by methods known to those skilled in the art or may result from normal protein processing (e.g., removal of amino acids from the nascent polypeptide that are not required for biological activity or removal of amino acids by alternative mRNA splicing or alternative protein processing events).	Preferable fragments or analogs according to the invention are those which facilitate specific detection of a CeSERT nucleic acid or amino acid sequence in a sample to be assayed.	Screening Systems for Identifying Therapeutic Agents	Based on our experimental results, we have developed a number of screening procedures for identifying compounds that modulate the biological activity of a serotonin reuptake transporter. These compounds may be used as therapeutic agents (e.g., pharmaceuticals to treat or prevent disorders associated with serotonin-mediated cellular responses), or may be leads for such compounds, and can be used in human patients. In particular examples, these compounds specifically decrease or increase serotonin reuptake transporter biological activity, such as the biological activity of CeSERT or its human homolog hSERT. Also useful in the invention are compounds that specifically affect serotonin receptors and/or a serotonin-gated ion channel. In general, the screening methods of the invention involve screening any number of compounds for therapeutically active agents by employing various in vitro or in vivo experimental systems. These screens may be carried out in a nematode expressing either a wild-type or mutant CeSERT gene, or expressing a truncated CeSERT polypeptide that functions like a wild-type CeSERT polypeptide. These screens may also be carried out in the presence or absence of a compound that affects the serotonergic pathway in C. elegans or other animals, for example, humans.	The CeSERT genes, polypeptides, and strains of the present invention may be used in drug design methods. For example, wild-type CeSERT has a pharmacology that is distinct from other existing SERTs, and these pharmacological characteristics may represent clues as to how drugs that affect SERT function mediate their effects. Sequence comparisons between hSERT and CeSERT reveal the regions of the polypeptides that lead to the differential pharmacology. The information obtained from this analysis will lead to the targeted development of therapeutic compounds that are specific in their effects on hSERT.	In addition, the CeSERT point mutations of the present invention, with a partial loss of CeSERT gene function, may identify specific amino acid residues that are important for maximal SERT function. Therapeutic compounds aimed at these sites, or aimed at avoiding these sites, may lead to the modification of existing therapeutic agents or the development of new therapeutic agents.	Furthermore, the truncated CeSERT polypeptide of the present invention, that still maintains wild-type CeSERT activity, may also be useful in identifying or designing SERT modulatory compounds. For example, the truncated CeSERT of the present invention encodes only two-thirds of the wild-type CeSERT polypeptide, yet maintains CeSERT polypeptide activity. This truncated CeSERT, or any other CeSERT polypeptide that has been further truncated, yet still maintains wild-type polypeptide activity, may be used as a target for rational drug design. A therapeutic compound designed using the truncated CeSERT polypeptide may be more efficacious than one designed using the full-length polypeptide as a target, because the truncated polypeptide is a better-defined target. For example, a therapeutic compound that modulates the function of a truncated SERT may modulate the endogenous (full-length) SERT better than a drug that was originally selected to target the full-length SERT, or may have fewer side effects because it may not bind to other portions of the full-length SERT.	The CeSERT genes, polypeptides, and strains of the present invention may also be used to screen for new drugs that modulate SERT activity. With the knowledge of the present invention that wild-type C. elegans have an endogenous SERT and that C. elegans with mutated CeSERT genes have specific phenotypes, therapeutic drug screens may be carried out in C. elegans, assaying their behaviors. These in vivo screens for compounds that modulate SERT function are different from the in vitro screens that have been done to date and that have resulted in the identification of therapeutic agents that are currently available on the market.	In the same screening methods of the present invention, the SERT is in its native biological context and interacts with other components of the serotonin pathway in a normal way. In such an in vivo setting, a high-throughput drug screen can generate an entirely new class of lead compounds that directly affect the function of SERTs, including an hSERT. In addition, such an in vivo screen provides access to the entire pathway of molecules that interface with SERT. Therefore, such screening methods may identify completely new classes of drugs whose immediate target is not SERT, but rather a molecule that is upstream of SERT.	The present invention also provides methods for identifying compounds that have few or no side effects. Side effects of drugs arise as a consequence of complex interactions of a compound with the entire biological system of the human body. For this reason, a lead compound with excellent promise in an in vitro assay may be found to be unsuitable after testing in humans or other animals.	C. elegans is an appropriate model for gaining an understanding of the range of a drug's effects in an animal model system. C. elegans systems are currently being used for screening for therapeutic agents with relevance to human diseases, and many clinically used compounds, particularly those that perturb serotonin neurotransmission, affect C. elegans in a biologically relevant and tractable manner.	The C. elegans strains of the present invention, with little or no SERT function, may be used to assay the effects of therapeutic compounds at an in vivo level in a variety of ways. Existing drugs, including serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, for example, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxatine; monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other antidepressants, including citalopram, may be tested for side effects using the methods of the present invention. In addition, migraine medications, for example, sumatriptan and rizatriptan, and anti-emetics, such as granisetron and ondansetron, may also be assayed for their side effects. While much is known about the mechanism of action of such therapeutic compounds, very little is known regarding the side effects of these compounds. In addition, compounds that counteract these side effects may also be tested.	As an example of how the C. elegans strains of the present invention may be used to assay the effects of therapeutic compounds in an in vivo setting, compounds identified to modulate SERT may be evaluated for their SERT-independent effects (side effects) by administering the compound to C. elegans carrying a mutation in CeSERT that reduces or eliminates SERT function. A compound that has no effect on a C. elegans strain with a deletion in the CeSERT gene is likely to have fewer side effects than a compound that has an effect on a strain carrying a deletion in the CeSERT gene. Examples of SERT-independent effects or side effects include altered locomotion, pharyngeal pumping, egg-laying, nose contraction, and defecation behaviors.	If a compound does have an effect on a strain carrying a deletion in CeSERT, that phenotype can then be used to identify and clone the genes in C. elegans that encode the secondary targets. Cloning of these secondary targets, in turn, can lead to the identification of molecules in humans that are responsible for the side effects caused by drugs that modulate SERT function.	In addition, the methods, genes, and strains of the present invention can be used to identify compounds that modulate hSERT function. Transgenic C. elegans strains that contain a deletion in the CeSERT gene and express a wild-type hSERT polypeptide can be utilized in high-throughput screens to identify agonists and antagonists of human SERT. Compounds that may be tested include ones that are untested for their ability to modulate serotonin neurotransmission, as well as chemically modified derivatives of known compounds that modulate SERT. Such compounds may be more efficacious than the known compounds. Screens, such as these should yield compounds that may be used as therapeutic agents for humans, especially since the compounds are identified through in vivo assays, wherein hSERT approximates its function in humans far better than what can be achieved through in vitro assays.	In addition, a screening system involving transgenic C. elegans strains that contain a deletion in the CeSERT gene and express a wild-type hSERT polypeptide can be used to identify compounds that interface indirectly with hSERT function. For example, if an endogenous kinase is required for turning on hSERT function, then an inhibitor of such a kinase would result in lower SERT function. Such a result would be manifested in the same manner as a direct serotonin reuptake inhibitor. However, the mechanisms of regulation through the kinase could yield vastly different kinetics and/or magnitudes in hSERT function. It is quite possible that such an interaction would have a dramatically different therapeutic consequence, one that could not have been arrived at using an in vitro assay.	The methods of the present invention simplify the evaluation, identification, and development of active agents for the treatment and prevention of conditions associated with serotonin-mediated cellular responses, such as depression, panic disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, sleep disorders, eating disorders, nausea, vomiting, other gastrointestinal disorders, and migraines, and the side effects associated with these drugs. In general, the screening methods provide a facile means for selecting natural or synthesized product extracts or compounds of interest from a large population that are further evaluated and condensed to a few active and selective materials. Constituents of this pool are then purified and evaluated using the methods of the invention to determine their ability to modulate serotonin-mediated responses and conditions.	Test Extracts and Compounds	In general, novel drugs for the treatment or prevention of serotonin-mediated cellular responses and conditions are identified from large libraries of both natural products, synthetic (or semi-synthetic) extracts or chemical libraries, according to methods known in the art. Those skilled in the field of drug discovery and development will understand that the precise source of test extracts or compounds is not critical to the screening procedure(s) of the invention. Accordingly, virtually any number of chemical extracts or compounds can be screened using the exemplary methods described herein. Examples of such extracts or compounds include, but are not limited to, plant-, fungal-, prokaryotic- or animal-based extracts, fermentation broths, and synthetic compounds, as well as modifications of existing compounds. Numerous methods are also available for generating random or directed synthesis (e.g., semi-synthesis or total synthesis) of any number of chemical compounds, including, but not limited to, saccharide-, lipid-, peptide-, and nucleic acid-based compounds. Synthetic compound libraries are commercially available from, for example, Brandon Associates (Merrimack, N.H.) and Aldrich Chemical (Milwaukee, Wis.).	Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal extracts are commercially available from a number of sources, including, but not limited to, Biotics (Sussex, UK), Xenova (Slough, UK), Harbor Branch Oceangraphics Institute (Ft. Pierce, Fla.), and PharmaMar, U.S.A. (Cambridge, Mass.). In addition, natural and synthetically produced libraries are produced, if desired, according to methods known in the art (e.g., by combinatorial chemistry methods or standard extraction and fractionation methods). Furthermore, if desired, any library or compound may be readily modified using standard chemical, physical, or biochemical methods.	In addition, those skilled in the art of drug discovery and development readily understand that methods for dereplication (e.g., taxonomic dereplication, biological dereplication, and chemical dereplication, or any combination thereof) or the elimination of replicates or repeats of materials already known for their effects on compounds associated with serotonin-mediated cellular responses should be employed whenever possible.	When a crude extract is found to affect serotonin-mediated cellular responses or conditions, further fractionation of the positive lead extract is necessary to isolate chemical constituents responsible for the observed effect. Thus, the goal of the extraction, fractionation, and purification process is the careful characterization and identification of a chemical entity within the crude extract having activities that affect serotonin-mediated cellular responses. The same in vivo and in vitro assays described herein for the detection of activities in mixtures of compounds can be used to purify the active component and to test derivatives thereof. Methods of fractionation and purification of such heterogenous extracts are known in the art. If desired, compounds shown to be useful agents for the treatment of pathogenicity are chemically modified according to methods known in the art. Compounds identified as being of therapeutic value are subsequently analyzed using any standard animal model of serotonin-mediated cellular responses known in the art.	Assays to be used for identifying compounds that affect serotonin-mediated cellular responses include assaying locomotion rates of nematodes exposed to candidate compounds. It also includes adding a candidate compound to a cell and assaying serotonin reuptake transporter expression at the nucleic acid level or at the polypeptide level. The changes in serotonin reuptake transporter RNA levels can be monitored by Northern blots, or by highly sensitive quantitative RT-PCR assays. The changes in the levels of serotonin reuptake transporter polypeptides can be monitored through the use of standard Western blot analyses or immunohistochemistry.	Administration	A modulator of serotonin reuptake transporter biological activity may be administered within a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent, carrier, or excipient, in unit dosage form. Conventional pharmaceutical practice may be employed to provide suitable formulations or compositions to administer the compounds to patients suffering from a condition associated with serotonin-mediated cellular responses. Administration may begin before the patient is symptomatic. Any appropriate route of administration may be employed, for example, administration may be parenteral, intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intracranial, intraorbital, ophthalmic, intraventricular, intracapsular, intraspinal, intracisternal, intraperitoneal, intranasal, aerosol, suppository, or oral. Therapeutic formulations may be in the form of liquid solutions or suspensions; for oral administration, formulations may be in the form of tablets or capsules; and for intranasal formulations, in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols.	Methods well known in the art for making formulations are found, for example, in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” ((18th edition), ed. A. Gennano, 1990, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa.). Formulations for parenteral administration may contain, for example, excipients, sterile water, or saline, polyalkylene glycols, such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, or hydrogenated napthalenes. Biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymers, lactide/glycolide copolymers, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers may be used to control the release of the compounds. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for serotonin reuptake transporter modulatory compounds include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes. Formulations for inhalation may contain excipients, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or may be oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel.	If desired, treatment with serotonin reuptake transporter mutant proteins, related genes, or other modulatory compounds may be combined with more traditional therapies for conditions associated with serotonin-mediated cellular responses. For example, a compound identified by the methods of the present invention may be combined with antidepressants, including a tricyclic antidepressant, monoamine oxidase inhibitor, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, a migraine medication, or an anti-emetic.	The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting.	EXAMPLES	Example 1	Identification of a Compound that Modulates the Biological Activity of a Nematode Serotonin Reuptake Transporter in a Liquid Locomotion Assay	A nematode expressing either a wild-type or mutant C. elegans CeSERT gene, such as CeSERT(n823), CeSERT(n822), or CeSERT(n3314), is exposed to a test compound. The test compound is obtained from any number of sources, as described above, and each test compound is used in this assay at a variety of concentrations in order to determine the optimal dose that modulates the biological activity of a nematode serotonin reuptake transporter. Exposure of a nematode to a test compound is achieved by placing the desired test compound into a well of a 96-well polystyrene plate, followed by placing 20 nematodes into each well containing a test compound. After 5 to 20 minutes, the number of non-swimming nematodes is determined by viewing the worms under a dissecting microscope. This number is compared to the number of nematodes not swimming in a well to which the test compound vehicle, but no test compound, is added. If the number of non-swimming nematodes is greater in a well to which a test compound is added, then this test compound is identified as a compound that modulates the biological activity of a nematode serotonin reuptake transporter. However, one may also determine the number of swimming nematodes, relative to the total number of nematodes, in the presence and absence of the test compound and thereby identify a compound that modulates the biological activity of a nematode reuptake transporter.	
US20050166270_0006	In addition to swimming in a liquid locomotion assay, examples of defined behaviors that may be looked at to measure the biological activity of a serotonin reuptake transporter include alterations in locomotion, pharyngeal pumping, egg-laying, nose contraction, and defecation behaviors.	Example 2	Identification of a Compound that Modulates the Biological Activity of a Mammalian Serotonin Reuptake Transporter in a Liquid Locomotion Assay	Transgenic nematodes in which the endogenous CeSERT gene is mutated and a mammalian CeSERT gene, for example, hSERT is expressed, is generated using standard techniques known to those skilled in the fields of nematode genetics and molecular biology. The nematodes are exposed to various concentrations of a test compound derived from any number of sources, as described above. Exposure of the nematodes to a test compound is achieved by placing the desired test compound into a well of a 96-well polystyrene plate, followed by placing 20 nematodes into each well containing a test compound. After 5 to 20 minutes, the number of nematodes not swimming is determined by viewing the nematodes under a microscope. This number is compared to the number of non-swimming transgenic nematodes expressing the same mammalian CeSERT gene in a well to which test compound vehicle, but no test compound, is added. If the number of non-swimming nematodes is greater in a well to which a test compound is added, then this test compound is identified as a compound that modulates the biological activity of a mammalian serotonin reuptake transporter. However, one may also determine the number of swimming nematodes, relative to the total number of nematodes, in the presence and absence of the test compound and thereby identify a compound that modulates the biological activity of a mammalian reuptake transporter.	Example 3	Determination as to Whether an Identified Compound has a Secondary Target	Any compound identified to modulate the biological activity of a serotonin reuptake transporter using the assays described above may be further tested to determine if it also has a secondary target. To make this determination, a nematode expressing a mutated serotonin reuptake transporter is provided. This mutated serotonin reuptake transporter may be, for example, mutated CeSERT or hSERT and may have a reduced capacity to take up serotonin relative the wild-type protein.	Nematodes expressing a mutated serotonin reuptake transporter are exposed to the compound to be tested for a secondary target. Exposure of the nematodes to such a compound, is achieved by placing the compound into a well of a 96-well polystyrene plate, followed placing 20 nematodes into the same well. After 5 to 20 minutes, the biological activity of the nematodes exposed to the compound is measured and compared to the biological activity of nematodes that did not receive the compound. Examples of biological activities that may be measured include alterations in locomotion, pharyngeal pumping, egg-laying, nose contraction, and defecation behaviors. In order to determine the optimal concentration at which a biological activity is measured, each compound to be examined for a secondary target may be used in this assay at a variety of concentrations.	Example 4	The Use of CeSERT Deletion Mutants in the Identification of CeSERT Modulatory Compounds	A truncated CeSERT polypeptide of the present invention that still maintains wild-type CeSERT activity may also be useful in identifying or designing SERT modulatory compounds. For example, we have determined that a wild-type CeSERT polypeptide that has been truncated to contain only the 421 most N-terminal amino acids (SEQ ID NO:9) still maintains wild-type polypeptide biological activity. This truncated CeSERT, or any other CeSERT polypeptide that has been further truncated, yet still maintains significant wild-type polypeptide biological activity, is used as a target for rational drug design. A therapeutic agent designed using the truncated CeSERT polypeptide may be more efficacious than a drug designed using the full-length polypeptide as a target, because the truncated polypeptide is a better-defined target. For example, a therapeutic agent that modulates the function of a truncated SERT might modulate the endogenous (full-length) SERT better than a drug that was originally selected to modulate the biological activity of a full-length SERT, and might also have fewer side effects.	Example 5	Use of High-Throughput Screens to Identify Compounds that Modulate the Biological Activity of a SERT or Affect a Secondary Target of an Identified Compound	In vivo assays for the identification of compounds that modulate the biological activity of a SERT or affect a secondary target of an identified compound can be accelerated. The rate-limiting step in the identification of modulatory compounds and secondary targets is placing the nematodes into wells containing test compounds. This process can be made more efficient using, for example, a Large Particle Dispenser (Becton, Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Using this dispenser, the desired number of nematodes (for example, 20) can be sorted into each well of a 96- or 384-well plate containing the compound to be tested or control. Preferably the nematodes have a mutated SERT gene and express the wild-type human SERT gene.	After 5 to 20 minutes, the number of non-swimming nematodes is determined by viewing the worms under a dissecting microscope. This visual inspection can be quickly assessed as one is simply determining whether or not there is locomotion in each well. If a well contains nematodes that are no longer moving, then the test compound in that specific well is identified as a compound that modulates the biological activity of a nematode serotonin reuptake transporter. Automated high-throughput ways to speed up the process of determining if the animals are moving also exist and can be incorporated into the screen.	Any compound identified to modulate the biological activity of a serotonin reuptake transporter using the assays described above may be further tested to determine if it also has a secondary target. To make this determination, a nematode expressing a mutated serotonin reuptake transporter is provided. This mutated serotonin reuptake transporter may be, for example, mutated CeSERT or hSERT.	Nematodes expressing a mutated serotonin reuptake transporter are sorted into wells containing the compounds of interest or controls using a Large Particle Dispenser. After 5 to 20 minutes, the biological activity of the nematodes exposed to the compound is measured and compared to the biological activity of nematodes that did not receive the compound. Examples of biological activities that may be measured include alterations in locomotion, pharyngeal pumping, egg-laying, and defecation behaviors. If nematodes carrying a mutated CeSERT or hSERT are affected by a test compound, this compound is then identified as having SERT-independent effects (side effects) resulting from secondary targets of the test compound.	Example 6	Materials and Methods	mod-5 Mapping, Cloning, and cDNA Isolation	Nematodes were grown at 20° C. using E. coli strain HB101 as the food source (Sawin et al., Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000). Wild-type animals were C. elegans strain N2. mod-5(n822) and mod-5(n823) were isolated from a genetic screen in which clonal populations of F3 animals descended from P0 animals mutagenized with ethyl methanesulphonate (Brenner, Science 282: 2012-2018, 1974) were pretreated with serotonin (15 min incubation in 500 μl of 13 mM serotonin followed by two washes with M9) and then examined for the presence of the NSMs using FIF (Sulston et al., J Comp Neurol 163: 215-226, 1975). mod-5(n3314) was isolated from a library of animals mutagenized with UV/trimethylpsoralen (Jansen et al., Nat Genet 17: 119-121, 1997). The deletion library was constructed essentially as described in Jansen et al. (Nat Genet 17: 119-121, 1997) and Liu et al. (Genome Res 9: 859-867, 1999). mod-5(n3314) was backcrossed to the wild-type six times prior to behavioral assays. Furthermore, mod-5(n823) was mapped to LG I based upon two-factor linkage to dpy-5 unc-75 I. The following three-factor data were obtained: mod-5 (47/47) dpy-5 (0/47) unc-75, mod-5 (35/35) unc-73 (0/35) lin-44 dpy-5, lin-6 (27/27) lin-17 (0/27) mod-5, lin-17 (13/13) fog-1 (0/13) mod-5, and fog-1(3/26) mod-5 (23/26) unc-11. All mapping experiments were performed by mating hermaphrodites homozygous for the recombinant chromosome with mod-5(n823) males and scoring the F1 cross progeny for serotonin hypersensitivity at 5 min in 10 mM serotonin.	Long-range PCR was performed using the Advantage cDNA PCR kit (Clontech). DNA sequences were determined using an automated ABI 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). RT-PCR was performed with primers corresponding to exons predicted by Genefinder (The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, 1998). The 5′ and 3′ ends of the mod-5 cDNA were determined using 5′- and 3′-RACE kits (Gibco), respectively. We showed that the cDNA is functional (see above), which indicates that no exons are missing in the predicted gene structure. The mod-5 open reading frame is 2,016 bp within a 2,594 bp cDNA. The extent of the 1,688 bp n3314 deletion is depicted.	To construct the mod-5 minigene, we used PCR and primers that contained restriction enzyme sites at their ends to amplify 2.7 kb of the mod-5 promoter region. A Pst I-Bam HI fragment of this PCR product was ligated into the pPD49.26 vector digested with Pst I and Bam HI. This mod-5 promoter construct was then digested with Nco I and Sac I and ligated to an Nco I-Sac I fragment of the mod-5 coding region, PCR-amplified in a manner similar to that used for the mod-5 promoter region.	C. elegans Germline Transformation	Germline transformation experiments (Mello et al., EMBO J. 10: 3959-3970, 1991) were performed by injecting various constructs with 80 μg/ml pL 15EK (which contains the wild-type lin-15 gene) into a mod-5(n823); lin-15(n765ts) strain and scoring serotonin sensitivity in transgenic lines that produced non-Lin progeny at 22.5° C.	Liquid Locomotion Assay	Fluoxetine (HCl salt, Sigma) was dissolved in water, and 400 μl of a 25× stock solution were added to each 5 cm plate, containing approximately 10 ml of agar, to obtain the various final concentrations of fluoxetine. The plates were allowed to dry at room temperature with their lids removed for more than 2 hours.	Animals to be tested for sensitivity or insensitivity to serotonin in this liquid locomotion assay were picked as L4 animals 16-20 hours prior to assay and the plates were coded so that the experimenter was blind to the genotype of the animals to be scored. On the day of the assay, serotonin (as a creatinine sulphate salt) was dissolved just before use, in M9, at the required concentrations, and 200 PI were aliquoted to the wells of a flat-bottomed 96-well polystyrene plate. To assay serotonin hypersensitivity, we placed 20 animals in 200 μl of serotonin solution (creatinine sulphate salt, Sigma, dissolved in M9 buffer; Wood et al., 1988) in 96-well microtiter wells and scored the swimming behavior of the animals as either active or immobile at 5 min; an animal was scored as immobile if it did not exhibit any swimming motion for a period of 5 seconds. Fluoxetine-induced paralysis was scored in a similar manner at 10 min.	For the experiment shown in FIG. 2, well-fed and food-deprived animals were transferred to assay plates with or without a bacterial lawn, and the locomotory rate of each animal was recorded after 5 min; food-deprived animals were transferred to plates without bacteria 30 min prior to the transfer to locomotory assay plates as is also described in Sawin et al. (Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000). At least 10 trials were performed for each genotype for each condition. For FIG. 2, each trial involved testing at least five animals for each of the conditions; a given animal was tested in only one condition. p values were calculated by comparing the combined data for the mutants from all of the separate trials under one set of conditions to the combined data for the wild-type animals assayed in parallel under the same conditions. In FIG. 2B the data were obtained from three well-fed animals of each ablation state, seven mock-ablated and food-deprived animals, and 12 NSM-ablated and food-deprived animals. In FIG. 2D, serotonin dose-response curves for wild-type and mod-5 mutant animals were generated from averages of five trials with 20 animals of each genotype at each concentration in which animals were scored for movement after 5 min.	Additional Locomotion Assays	Alternatively, nematodes to be tested in a non-liquid locomotion assay were picked as L4 animals 16-20 hours prior to the assay. Locomotion was assayed by placing the nematode on an assay plate (prepared by spreading a solution of E. coli strain HB101 in NGM agar in 5 cm plates, using a ring with an inner diameter of approximately 1 cm and an outer diameter of approximately 3.5 cm, and allowing the bacteria to grow 13-15 hours at 37 C), observing each nematode under a dissecting microscope for 20 seconds, and counting the number of dorsal-ventral bends that occurred in the anterior portion of the body during the interval.	For satiated animals, locomotion rates were assayed by removing 5 animals from plates with ample bacteria, washing them in S-basal buffer, and transferring them to the clear zone of the bacterial lawn of an assay plate using a capillary pipette. Beginning 5 minutes after transfer, the number of body bends was counted as described above. This procedure was performed for each of the 5 animals.	To assay locomotion rates in food-deprived animals, 5-15 animals were removed from plates with ample food, washed twice in S-basal buffer, and transferred to 5 cm NGM agar plates without bacteria. Food-deprived animals were incubated on these plates for 30 minutes at room temperature, and then were transferred to assay plates. Locomotion rates were assayed as described above for satiated animals.	As compared to wild-type nematodes, the n822 and n823 mutants obtained from a screen for C. elegans defective in staining of the serotonergic NSM neurons, exhibit a recessive phenotype of slowing down more after being deprived of bacteria and then returned to a bacterial lawn in the locomotion assays. This same effect was observed in the n3314 mutants.	Laser microsurgery	Neurons were ablated during the second larval stage using a laser microbeam, as described in Avery and Horvitz, (Cell 51: 1071-1078, 1987) and Bargmann and Horvitz, (Neuron 7: 729-742, 1991). Behavioral assays of young adult animals were performed two days later. Mock-ablated animals were animals transferred to agar pads and anesthetized in parallel to the animals that underwent laser ablation. Sawin et al. (Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000) describe details concerning how ablated animals were assayed sequentially in each of the different behavioral conditions.	Erg-Laying Assays	Egg-laying assays were performed as described in Trent et al. (Genetics 104: 619-647, 1983). Briefly, one day-old adult animals (staged by picking late L4 animals 36 hours prior to the assay) were placed in wells of microtiter dishes containing 100 μl of 12.5 mM serotonin or 500 μg/ml fluoxetine, and the number of eggs laid was counted after 90 minutes.	Serotonin-Uptake Assays in vivo	FIF assays were performed as described by Sulston et al. (J Comp Neurol 163: 215-226, 1975). For the anti-serotonin antisera experiments shown in FIG. 1B, mod-5(n823); cat-4 and cat-4; lin-15(n765ts) double mutants were grown at 20° C., and animals of both genotypes were incubated separately on plates containing 2 mM serotonin and bacteria (see Sawin et al. (Neuron 26: 619-623, 2000) for details concerning how plates were prepared) for two hours and then incubated on plates with bacteria but without serotonin for 30 min. Controls without exogenous serotonin were similarly treated in parallel. Prior to fixation, mod-5(n823); cat-4 and cat-4; lin-15 double mutants preincubated on serotonin-containing plates were combined, and mod-5(n823); cat-4 and cat-4; lin-15 double mutants preincubated on control plates were combined. Serotonin staining was performed as described by Desai et al. (Nature 336: 638-646, 1988) using affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-serotonin antisera. The cat-4; lin-15 mutants were not defective in the uptake of serotonin and served as internal controls for each staining reaction. These animals could be distinguished from the test animals by the Multivulva phenotype caused by lin-15. Neurons with bright staining in cell bodies, axonal processes, and varicosities were termed “bright” and neurons with weak staining in just the cell bodies and axonal processes were termed “weak.” For the results in Table 1, the procedure was essentially the same, except that the animals experienced an additional 1 hour incubation on control or fluoxetine-containing plates prior to the 2 hour incubation with serotonin but did not experience the 30 min incubation on plates without drug after the serotonin preincubation (see Table 1 legend for details). lin-15 adult animals, grown at 22.5° C. were added to all plates at the first incubation step and these animals served as internal controls for the staining reaction.	MOD-5-Mediated Uptake in Mammalian Cells	We used a modified version of the MSCVpac vector (Hawley et al., Gene Ther 1: 136-138, 1994) in which the pac gene had been replaced with the gfp gene (GFP vector). We modified the GFP vector as follows: The ends of a Bgl II-Mfe I fragment containing the entire mod-5 cDNA were blunted using the Kienow fragment of DNA polymerase I and then ligated to the GFP vector digested with Hpa I, placing mod-5 under the control of the retroviral long terminal repeat promoter (GFPMOD-5). The Phoenix packaging cell line (ATCC #CRL-1817) was used to generate virus containing either GFPMOD-5 or GFP vector. HEK293 cells were infected with these viral stocks in the presence of 4 mg/ml polybrene, and clones expressing high levels of GFP were isolated using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACstar or FACSvantage; Becton Dickinson). The GFPMOD-5 clones were then screened for MOD-5 CeSERT-mediated [3H]serotonin uptake activity, and one clone was chosen for use in all further uptake experiments. Cells were plated at 106 cells/well of a 6-well dish and allowed to grow overnight before being assayed. Cells were incubated in prewarmed wash buffer (120 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.8 mg/ml glucose, 100 μM pargyline, 100 μM ascorbic acid) for 10 min at 37° C. and the buffer was then replaced with prewarmed wash buffer plus substrate.	In FIG. 4B, the NaCl was substituted with an equivalent amount of sodium gluconate or choline chloride. Except for the trials shown in FIGS. 4C and D, 50 nM [3H]serotonin was used as substrate (there was no dilution with non-radioactive substrate in these experiments). Since micromolar amounts of substrate were used in the trials shown in FIGS. 4C and D, radiolabeled substrates were diluted with non-radioactive substrate to maintain a specific activity of 0.1 Ci/mmol. In FIG. 4D, assays were performed with 1 μM [3H]serotonin and 50 μM of each of the other radiolabeled neurotransmitters, and the results are presented as a percentage of normalized 1 μM [3H]serotonin uptake. There was no detectable transport when neurotransmitters other than serotonin were added at 1 μM. Uptake was allowed to proceed at 37° C. for varying times for the time course and for 10 min in all other experiments. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold wash buffer, solubilized in 1% SDS and the radioactivity retained in the cells was determined by liquid scintillation. Cell numbers, quantified in parallel wells taken through all steps of the assay, were used to convert counts per minute (cpm) to nmoles per cell per min. The specific uptake of each substrate for each condition was obtained by subtracting the average value obtained from at least three trials with the GFP vector cell line from the average value obtained from at least six trials with the GFPMOD-5 cell line. Inhibitor Ki values were determined from concentration vs. uptake profiles after adjustment for substrate concentrations (Cheng and Prusoff, Biochem Pharmacol 22: 3099-3108, 1973). Statistical significance was evaluated using the Student's t-test (Statview).

FIELD OF THE INVENTION	The present invention relates to certain novel benzoic acid derivatives, to processes for preparing such compounds, to their utility in treating clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance, to methods for their therapeutic use and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	The Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IRS) including type 2 diabetes mellitus, which refers to a cluster of manifestations including insulin resistance with accompanying hyperinsulnaemia, possible type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, central (visceral) obesity, dyslipidaemia observed as deranged lipoprotein levels typically characterised by elevated VLDL (very low density lipoproteins), small dense LDL particles and reduced HDL (high density lipoprotein) concentrations and reduced fibrinolysis.	Recent epidemiological research has documented that individuals with insulin resistance run a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, notably suffering from myocardial infarction and stroke. In type 2 diabetes mellitus atherosclerosis related conditions cause up to 80% of all deaths.	In clinical medicine there is awareness of the need to increase the insulin sensitivity in IRS suffering patients and thus to correct the dyslipidaemia which is considered to cause the accelerated progress of atherosclerosis. However, currently this is not a universally well defined disease.	The S-enantiomer of the compound of formula C below	2-ethoxy-3-[4-(2-{4-methanesulfonyloxyphenyl}ethoxy)phenyl]propanoic acid, is disclosed in PCT Publication Number WO99/62872. This compound is reported to be a modulator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR, for a review of the PPARs see T. M. Willson et al, J Med Chem 2000, Vol 43, 527) and has combined PPARα/PPARγ agonist activity (Structure, 2001, Vol 9, 699, P. Cronet et al). This compound is effective in treating conditions associated with insulin resistance. Surprisingly a series of compounds has now been found which are selective PPARα modulators.	DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION	The present invention provides a compound of formula I	
US20050222261_0002	wherein n is 0, 1 or 2;	R1 represents halo, a C1-4alkyl group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro, a C1-4alkoxy group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro and wherein when n is 2 the substituents R1 may be the same or different;  R2 represents an unbranched C2-7alkyl group;  R3 represents H or OCH3; and  W represents O or S	and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof.	Further values of R1, R2, R3 and W in compounds of Formula I now follow. It will be understood that such values may be used with any of the definitions, claims or embodiments defined hereinbefore or hereinafter.	In a first aspect R1 is halo, a C1-4alkyl group or a C1-4alkoxy group and n is 0, 1 or 2. Particularly R1 is fluoro, chloro or trifluoromethyl when n is 1. Particularly R1 is fluoro when n is 2.	In a second aspect R2 represents ethyl or hexyl.	In a third aspect R3 represents H.	In a fourth aspect R3 represents OMe.	In a fifth aspect W represents O.	In a sixth aspect W represents S.	The term unbranched C2-7alkyl denotes a straight-chain, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon having from 2 to 7 carbon atoms. Examples of said alkyl include ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl n-pentyl, n-hexyl and n-heptyl.	It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the term interrupted as used above means that the oxygen atom is situated within the alkyl chain and is not the terminal atom. The term “prodrug” as used in this specification includes derivatives of the carboxylic acid group which are converted in a mammal, particularly a human, into the carboxylic acid group or a salt or conjugate thereof. It should be understood that, whilst not being bound by theory, it is believed that most of the activity associated with the prodrugs arises from the activity of the compound of formula I into which the prodrugs are converted. Prodrugs can be prepared by routine methodology well within the capabilities of someone skilled in the art. Various prodrugs of carboxy are known in the art.

However, the invention is not limited to these methods, the compounds may also be prepared as described for structurally related compounds in the prior art. The reactions can be carried out according to standard procedures or as described in the experimental section.	Compounds of formula I may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula II	in which R1, R2, R3, W and n are as previously defined and PG represents a protecting group for a carboxylic hydroxy group as described in the standard text “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, 2nd Edition (1991) by Greene and Wuts, with a de-protecting agent. The protecting group may also be a resin, such as Wang resin or 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin. Protecting groups may be removed in accordance to techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art. One such protecting group is where PG represents C1-6alkoxy group or an arylalkoxy group eg benzyl, such that COPG represents an ester. Such esters can be reacted with a hydrolysing agent, for example lithium hydroxide in the presence of a solvent for example a mixture of THF and water or potassium hydroxide in a C1-3 alcohol for example methanol, at a temperature in the range of 0-200° C. or by microwave radiation to give compounds of formula I.	Compounds of formula II may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula III	or a salt thereof, for example a hydrochloride salt, in which R1, R2 and n are as previously defined with a compound of formula IV	or the acid chloride thereof in which R3, W and PG are as previously defined in an inert solvent, for example dichloromathane, optionally in the presence of a coupling agent, for example 4-dimethylaminopyridine or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, at a temperature in the range of −25° C. to 150° C.	Compounds of formula II may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V	in which PG is as previously defined with a compound of formula VI	in which R1, R2, R3, W and n are as previously defined and L represents a leaving group, for example methylsulphonyloxy or halo, e.g. bromo, optionally in the presence of solvent, for example acetonitrille, and optionally in the presence of a base, for example potassium carbonate, at a temperature in the range of 0 to 150° C.	Compounds of formula III, IV, V and VI may be prepared by methods described in the Examples or by analogous methods known to those skilled in the art.	Compounds of formula II, III, IV and V are useful intermediates in the preparation of compounds of formula I. Certain of these compounds are believed to be novel. Novel compounds of formula II, or formula m, or formula IV or formula V are herein claimed as a further aspect of the present invention.	The compounds of the invention may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques.	Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that, in order to obtain compounds of the invention in an alternative and in some occasions, more convenient manner, the individual process steps mentioned hereinbefore may be performed in different order, and/or the individual reactions may be performed at different stage in the overall route (i.e. chemical transformations may be performed upon different intermediates to those associated hereinbefore with a particular reaction).	In any of the preceding methods of preparation, where necessary, hydroxy, amino or other reactive groups may be protected using a protecting group, Rp as described in the standard text “Protective groups in Organic Synthesis”, 2nd Edition (1991) by Greene and Wuts. The protecting group may also be a resin, such as Wang resin or 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin. The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after any of the reaction steps described hereinbefore. Protecting groups may be removed in accordance to techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art.	The expression “inert solvent” refers to a solvent which does not react with the starting materials, reagents, intermediates or products in a manner which adversely affects the yield of the desired product.

Pharmacological Properties	The present compounds of formula (I) are useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of clinical conditions associated with inherent or induced reduced sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance) and associated metabolic disorders (also known as metabolic syndrome). These clinical conditions will include, but will not be limited to, general obesity, abdominal obesity, arterial hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, type 2 diabetes and the dyslipidaemia characteristically appearing with insulin resistance. This dyslipidaemia, also known as the atherogenic lipoprotein profile, is characterised by moderately elevated non-esterified fatty acids, elevated very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride rich particles, high Apo B levels, low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels associated with low apoAI particle levels and high Apo B levels in the presence of small, dense, low density lipoproteins (LDL) particles, phenotype B.	The compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in treating patients with combined or mixed hyperlipidemias or various degrees of hypertriglyceridemias and postprandial dyslipidemia with or without other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome.	Treatment with the present compounds is expected to lower the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerosis due to their antidyslipidaemic as well as antiinflammatory properties. The cardiovascular disease conditions include macro-angiopathies of various internal organs causing myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities. Because of their insulin sensitizing effect the compounds of formula I are also expected to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes from the metabolic syndrome and diabetes of pregnancy. Therefore the development of long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia in diabetes mellitus such as the micro-angiopathies causing renal disease, retinal damage and peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs are expected to be delayed. Furthermore the compounds may be useful in treatment of various conditions outside the cardiovascular system whether or not associated with insulin resistance, like polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, cancer and states of inflammatory disease including neurodegenerative disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.	The compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in controlling glucose levels in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes.	The present invention provides a method of treating or preventing dyslipidemias, the insulin resistance syndrome and/or metabolic disorders (as defined above) comprising the administration of a compound of formula I to a mammal (particularly a human) in need thereof.

Confluent cells were trypsinised, washed and pelleted by centrifugation at 270×g for 2 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold PBS to a cell concentration of about 18×106 cells/ml. After addition of DNA, the cell suspension was incubated on ice for approximately 5 minutes before electroporation at 230 V, 960 μF in Biorad's Gene Pulser™ in 0.5 ml batches. A total of 50 μg DNA was added to each batch of 0.5 ml cells, including 2.5 μg expression vector, 25 μg reporter vector and 22.5 μg unspecific DNA (pBluescript, Stratagene).	After electroporation, cells were diluted to a concentration of 320,000 cells/ml in DMEM without phenol red, and approximately 25,000 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. In order to allow cells to recover, seeded plates were incubated at 37° C. for 3-4 hours before addition of test compounds. In assays for PPARα, the cell medium was supplemented with resin-charcoal stripped fetal calf serum (FCS) in order to avoid background activation by fatty acid components of the FCS. The resin-charcoal stripped FCS was produced as follows; for 500 ml of heat-inactivated FCS, 10 g charcoal and 25 g Bio-Rad Analytical Grade Anion Exchange Resin 200-400 mesh were added, and the solution was kept on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature over night. The following day, the FCS was centrifuged and the stripping procedure was repeated for 4-6 hours. After the second treatment, the FCS was centrifuged and filter sterilised in order to remove remnants of charcoal and resin.	Assay Procedure	Stock solutions of compounds in DMSO were diluted in appropriate concentration ranges in master plates. From master plates, compounds were diluted in culture media to obtain test compound solutions for final doses.	After adjustment of the amount of cell medium to 75 μl in each well, 50 μl test compound solution was added. Transiently transfected cells were exposed to compounds for about 24 hours before the luciferase detection assay was performed. For luciferase assays, 100 μl of assay reagent was added manually to each well and plates were left for approximately 20 minutes in order to allow lysis of the cells. After lysis, luciferase activity was measured in a 1420 Multiwell counter, Victor, from Wallach.	Reference Compounds	The TZD pioglitazone was used as reference substance for activation of both human and murine PPARγ. 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetrayonic acid (ETYA) was used as reference substance for human PPARα.	Calculations and Analysis	For calculation of EC50 values, a concentration-effect curve was established. Values used were derived from the average of two or three independent measurements (after subtraction of the background average value) and were expressed as the percentage of the maximal activation obtained by the reference compound. Values were plotted against the logarithm of the test compound concentration. EC50 values were estimated by linear intercalation between the data points and calculating the concentration required to achieve 50% of the maximal activation obtained by the reference compound.	The compounds of formula I have an EC50 of less than 50 μmol/l for PPARα and preferred compounds have an EC50 of less than 5 μmol/L For example the BC50s of some of the Examples for human PPAR alpha are:	Example 3	0.499 μmol/l; and	Example 5	0.048 μmol/l.	1.

The term may alternatively be an amount of a compound of the present invention, which when administered as a prodrug is converted to an amount of compound A which is effective to inhibit protein kinase activity or effective to treat or prevent oncological or immunological disorders.	As used herein, “treating” or “treatment” cover the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, and include: (a) preventing the disease-state from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the disease-state but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease-state, i.e., arresting it development; and/or (c) relieving the disease-state, i.e., causing regression of the disease state.	Throughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof are chosen to provide stable moieties and compounds.	When any variable (e.g., R) occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 R, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R groups and R at each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.	The position of R1 in the compounds of formula (Ia) and (Ib) are tautomers of each other. It is to be understood that some substituents may be more stable in the structure indicated by formula (Ia) while others may be more stable in the structure indicated by formula (Ib). Each of these regioisomers are intended to be covered by this invention.	UTILITY	The compounds of formula (Ia), (Ib), and/or (Ic) are expected to possess protein tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity either by themselves and/or after administration and removal of the prodrug groups and are therefore useful as agents for the treatment, including prevention and therapy, of protein tyrosine kinase-associated disorders such as oncologic and immunologic disorders. Following administration, the prodrug group is expected to be removed by chemical or enzymatic processes thereby releasing the active hydroxy-agent.	The compounds of the present invention and/or the compound of formula A after administration of the compound of the present invention inhibit protein tyrosine kinases, especially Src-family kinases such as Lck, Fyn, Lyn, Src, Yes, Hck, Fgr and Blk, and are thus useful in the treatment, including prevention and therapy, of protein tyrosine kinase-associated disorders such as oncologic and immunologic disorders. The compounds inhibit also receptor tyrosine kinases including HER1 and HER2 and are therefore useful in the treatment of proliferative disorders such as psoriasis and cancer. The ability of these compounds to inhibit HER1 and other receptor kinases will also permit their use as anti-angiogenic agents to treat disorders such as cancer and diabetic retinopathy. “Protein tyrosine kinase-associated disorders” are those disorders which result from aberrant tyrosine kinase activity, and/or which are alleviated by the inhibition of one or more of these enzymes. For example, Lck inhibitors are of value in the treatment of a number of such disorders (for example, the treatment of autoimmune diseases), as Lck inhibition blocks T cell activation. The treatment of T cell mediated diseases, including inhibition of T cell activation and proliferation, is a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention. Compounds which selectively block T cell activation and proliferation are preferred. Compounds of the present invention which block the activation of endothelial cell PTK by oxidative stress, thereby limiting surface expression of adhesion molecules that induce neutrophil binding, and which inhibit PTK necessary for neutrophil activation are useful, for example, in the treatment of ischemia and reperfusion injury.	The present invention thus provides methods for the treatment of protein tyrosine kinase-associated disorders, comprising the step of administering to a subject in need thereof at least one compound of the formula (Ia), (Ib), and/or (Ic) in an amount effective therefor. Other therapeutic agents such as those described below may be employed with the inventive compounds in the present methods. In the methods of the present invention, such other therapeutic agent(s) may be administered prior to, simultaneously with or following the administration of the compound(s) of the present invention.	The compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of cancers such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Philadelphia positive ALL, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, melanoma, mastocytosis, germ cell tumors, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), pediatric sarcomas, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and others known to be associated with protein tyrosine kinases such as, for example, SRC, BCR-ABL and c-KIT. The compounds of the present invention are also useful in the treatment of cancers that are sensitive to and resistant to chemotherapeutic agents that target BCR-ABL and c-KIT, such as, for example, Gleevec® (STI-571) and AMN-107.	Thus, the present invention provides methods for the treatment of a variety of cancers, including, but not limited to, the following:	carcinoma including that of the bladder (including accelerated and metastatic bladder cancer), breast, colon (including colorectal cancer), kidney, liver, lung (including small and non-small cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma), ovary, prostate, testes, genitourinary tract, lymphatic system, rectum, larynx, pancreas (including exocrine pancreatic carcinoma), esophagus, stomach, gall bladder, cervix, thyroid, and skin (including squamous cell carcinoma);  hematopoietic tumors of lymphoid lineage including leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, and Burketts lymphoma;  hematopoietic tumors of myeloid lineage including acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloid leukemia, and promyelocytic leukemia;  tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system including astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma, and schwannomas;  tumors of mesenchymal origin including fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyoscarcoma, and osteosarcoma; and  other tumors including melanoma, xenoderma pigmentosum, keratoactanthoma, seminoma, thyroid follicular cancer, and teratocarcinoma.	The present invention provides methods for the treatment of a variety of non-cancerous proliferative diseases. The invention is used to treat GIST, Breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, NSCLC, CML, and ALL, sarcoma, and various pediatric cancers.	Use of the compounds of the present invention in treating protein tyrosine kinase-associated disorders is exemplified by, but is not limited to, treating a range of disorders such as: cancer, transplant (such as organ transplant, acute transplant or heterograft or homograft (such as is employed in burn treatment)) rejection; protection from ischemic or reperfusion injury such as ischemic or reperfusion injury incurred during organ transplantation, myocardial infarction, stroke or other causes; transplantation tolerance induction; arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or osteoarthritis); multiple sclerosis; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as emphysema; inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease; lupus (systemic lupus erythematosis); graft vs. host disease; T-cell mediated hypersensitivity diseases, including contact hypersensitivity, delayed-type hypersensitivity, and gluten-sensitive enteropathy (Celiac disease); psoriasis; contact dermatitis (including that due to poison ivy); Hashimoto's thyroiditis; Sjogren's syndrome; Autoimmune Hyperthyroidism, such as Graves' Disease; Addison's disease (autoimmune disease of the adrenal glands); Autoimmune polyglandular disease (also known as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome); autoimmune alopecia; pernicious anemia; vitiligo; autoimmune hypopituatarism; Guillain-Barre syndrome; other autoimmune diseases; cancers, including cancers where Lck or other Src-family kinases such as Src are activated or overexpressed, such as colon carcinoma and thymoma, and cancers where Src-family kinase activity facilitates tumor growth or survival; glomerulonephritis; serum sickness; uticaria; allergic diseases such as respiratory allergies (asthma, hayfever, allergic rhinitis) or skin allergies; scleracierma; mycosis fungoides; acute inflammatory responses (such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and ishchemia/reperfusion injury); dermatomyositis; alopecia areata; chronic actinic dermatitis; eczema; Behcet's disease; Pustulosis palmoplanteris; Pyoderma gangrenum; Sezary's syndrome; atopic dermatitis; systemic schlerosis; and morphea. The present invention also provides a method for treating the aforementioned disorders such as atopic dermatitis by administration of any compound capable of inhibiting protein tyrosine kinase.	Src-family kinases other than Lck, such as Hck and Fgr, are important in the Fc gamma receptor responses of monocytes and macrophages. Compounds of the present invention inhibit the Fc gamma dependent production of TNF alpha in the monocyte cell line THP-1 that does not express Lck. The ability to inhibit Fc gamma receptor dependent monocyte and macrophage responses results in additional anti-inflammatory activity for the present compounds beyond their effects on T cells. This activity is especially of value, for example, in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, the present compounds are of value for the treatment of autoimmune glomerulonephritis and other instances of glomerulonephritis induced by deposition of immune complexes in the kidney that trigger Fc gamma receptor responses leading to kidney damage.	In addition, Src family kinases other than Lck, such as Lyn and Src, are important in the Fc epsilon receptor induced degranulation of mast cells and basophils that plays an important role in asthma, allergic rhinitis, and other allergic disease. Fc epsilon receptors are stimulated by IgE-antigen complexes. Compounds of the present invention inhibit the Fc epsilon induced degranulation responses, including in the basophil cell line RBL that does not express Lck. The ability to inhibit Fc epsilon receptor dependent mast cell and basophil responses results in additional anti-inflammatory activity for the present compounds beyond their effect on T cells. In particular, the present compounds are of value for the treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and other instances of allergic disease.	The combined activity of the present compounds towards monocytes, macrophages, T cells, etc. may be of value in the treatment of any of the aforementioned disorders.	In a particular embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of the aforementioned exemplary disorders irrespective of their etiology, for example, for the treatment of transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, graft v. host disease, T-cell mediated hypersensitivity disease, psoriasis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, cancer, contact dermatitis, allergic disease such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, ischemic or reperfusion injury, or atopic dermatitis whether or not associated with PTK.	By virtue of their ability to inhibit HER1 and HER2 kinases, compounds of the present invention can also be used for the treatment of proliferative diseases, including psoriasis and cancer. The HER1 receptor kinase has been shown to be expressed and activated in many solid tumors including non-small cell lung, colorectal, and breast cancer.	Similarly, the HER2 receptor kinase has been shown to be overexpressed in breast, ovarian, lung and gastric cancer. Monoclonal antibodies that downregulate the abundance of the HER2 receptor or inhibit signaling by the HER1 receptor have shown anti-tumor effficacy in preclincal and clinical studies. It is therefore expected that inhibitors of the HER1 and HER2 kinases will have efficacy in the treatment of tumors that depend on signaling from either of the two receptors. These compounds are expected to have efficacy either as single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents such as placlitaxel (Taxol), doxorubicin hydrochloride (adriamycin), and cisplatin (Platinol).

The effective amount of a compound of the present invention may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, and includes exemplary dosage amounts for an adult human of from about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg of body weight of active compound per day, which may be administered in a single dose or in the form of individual divided doses, such as from 1 to 4 times per day. It will be understood that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular subject may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the species, age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject, the mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the particular condition. Preferred subjects for treatment include animals, most preferably mammalian species such as humans, and domestic animals such as dogs, cats and the like, subject to protein tyrosine kinase-associated disorders.	When administered intravenously, the compounds of the present invention, including compounds of formula I, are preferably administered using the formulations of the invention. Generally, the compounds of the present invention, including compounds of formula (Ia), (Ib), and/or (Ic), are administered by IV infusion over a period of from about 10 minutes to about 3 hours, preferably about 30 minutes to about 2 hours, more preferably about 45 minutes to 90 minutes, and most preferably about 1 hour.

Anti-Her2 antibodies from Genetech may also be utilized. A suitable EGFR inhibitor is EKB-569 (an irreversible inhibitor). Also included are Imclone antibody C225 immunospecific for the EGFR, and src inhibitors. Also suitable for use as an antiproliferative cytostatic agent is Casodex™ which renders androgen-dependent carcinomas non-proliferative. Yet another example of a cytostatic agent is the antiestrogen Tamoxifen which inhibits the proliferation or growth of estrogen dependent breast cancer. Inhibitors of the transduction of cellular proliferative signals are cytostatic agents. Examples are epidermal growth factor inhibitors, Her-2 inhibitors, MEK-1 kinase inhibitors, MAPK kinase inhibitors, PI3 inhibitors, Src kinase inhibitors, and PDGF inhibitors.	As mentioned, certain anti-proliferative agents are anti-angiogenic and antivascular agents and, by interrupting blood flow to solid tumors, render cancer cells quiescent by depriving them of nutrition. Castration, which also renders androgen dependent carcinomas non-proliferative, may also be utilized. Starvation by means other than surgical disruption of blood flow is another example of a cytostatic agent. A particular class of antivascular cytostatic agents is the combretastatins. Other exemplary cytostatic agents include MET kinase inhibitors, MAP kinase inhibitors, inhibitors of non-receptor and receptor tyrosine kinases, inhibitors of integrin signaling, and inhibitors of insulin-like growth factor receptors.	The compounds of the present invention may be useful in combination with BCR-ABL inhibitors such as, but not limited to, Gleevec® (imatinib, STI-571) or AM-107.

The above other therapeutic agents, when employed in combination with the compounds of the present invention, may be used, for example, in those amounts indicated in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) or as otherwise determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.	It is desirable to find new compounds with improved pharmacological characteristics compared with known protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It is desirable to find compounds with advantageous and improved characteristics in one or more of the following categories: (a) pharmaceutical properties (i.e. solubility, permeability, amenability to sustained release formulations); (b) dosage requirements (e.g., lower dosages and/or once-daily dosing); (c) factors which decrease blood concentration peak-to-trough characteristics (i.e. clearance and/or volume of distribution); (d) factors that increase the concentration of active drug at the receptor (i.e. protein binding, volume of distribution); (e) factors that decrease the liability for clinical drug-drug interactions; (f) factors that decrease the potential for adverse side-effects (i.e. pharmacological selectivity beyond G protein-coupled receptors, potential chemical or metabolic reactivity, limited CNS penetration) (g) factors that improve manufacturing costs or feasibility (i.e. difficulty of synthesis, number of chiral centers, chemical stability, ease of handling).	The compounds of the present invention are active as protein kinase inhibitors either in their current composition or as prodrugs for the compound of Formula A.	The following assays can be employed in ascertaining the degree of activity of a compound (“test compound”) as a PTK inhibitor. Compounds described in the following Examples have been tested in one or more of these assays and/or act as prodrugs for the compound of formula A which has been tested in one or more of these assays, and have shown activity.	Enzyme Assay Using Lck, Fyn, Lyn, Hck, Fgr, Src, Blk or Yes	The following assay has been carried out using the protein tyrosine kinases Lck, Fyn, Lyn, Hck, Fgr, Src, Blk and Yes.	The protein tyrosine kinase of interest is incubated in kinase buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7, 10 mM MgCl2) in the presence of the test compound. The reaction is initiated by the addition of substrates to the final concentration of 1 μM ATP, 3.3 μCi/ml [33P] gamma-ATP, and 0.1 mg/ml acid denatured enolase (prepared as described in Cooper, J. A., Esch, F. S., Taylor, S. S., and Hunter, T., “Phosphorylation sites in enolase and lactate dehydrogenase utilized by tyrosine protein kinases in vivo and in vitro”, J. Biol. Chem., 259, 7835-7841 (1984)). The reaction is stopped after 10 minutes by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate followed by 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The labeled enolase protein substrate is precipitated at 4 degrees, harvested onto Packard Unifilter plates and counted in a Topcount scintillation counter to ascertain the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity of the test compound (activity inversely proportional to the amount of labeled enolase protein obtained). The exact concentration of reagents and the amount of label can be varied as needed.	This assay is advantageous as it employs an exogenous substrate (enolase) for more accurate enzyme kinetics, and can be conducted in a 96-well format that is readily automated. In addition, His-tagged protein tyrosine kinases (described below) offer much higher production yields and purity relative to GST-protein tyrosine kinase fusion protein.	The protein tyrosine kinase may be obtained from commercial sources or by recombinant methods described herewith. For the preparation of recombinant Lck, human Lck was prepared as a His-tagged fusion protein using the Life Technologies (Gibco) baculovirus vector pFastBac Hta (commercially available) in insect cells. A cDNA encoding human Lck isolated by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was inserted into the vector and the protein was expressed using the methods described by the manufacturer. The Lck was purified by affinity chromatography. For the production of Lck in insect cells using baculovirus, see Spana, C., O'Rourke, E. C., Bolen, J. B., and Fargnoli, J., “Analysis of the tyrosine kinase p56ck expressed as a glutathione S-transferase protein in Spodoptera frugiperda cells,” Protein expression and purification, Vol. 4, p. 390-397 (1993). Similar methods may be used for the recombinant production of other Src-family kinases.	Enzyme Assay Using HER1 or HER2	Compounds of interest were assayed in a kinase buffer that contained 20 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MnCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, bovine serum albumin at 0.1 mg/ml, poly(glu/tyr, 4:1) at 0.1 mg/ml, 1 μM ATP, and 4 μCi/ml [gamma-33P]ATP. Poly(glu/tyr, 4:1) is a synthetic polymer that serves as a phosphoryl acceptor and is purchased from Sigma Chemicals. The kinase reaction is initiated by the addition of enzyme and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 26° C. for 1 h. The reaction is terminated by the addition of EDTA to 50 mM and proteins are precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 5%. The precipitated proteins are recovered by filtration onto Packard Unifilter plates and the amount of radioactivity incorporated is measured in a Topcount scintillation counter.	For the preparation of recombinant HER1, the cytoplasmic sequence of the receptor were expressed in insect cells as a GST fusion protein, which was purified by affinity chromatography as described above for Lck. The cytoplasmic sequence of HER2 was subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pBlueBac4 (Invitrogen) and was expressed as an untagged protein in insect cells. The recombinant protein was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography.	Cell Assays	Cellular Tyrosine Phosphorylation	Jurkat T cells are incubated with the test compound and then stimulated by the addition of antibody to CD3 (monoclonal antibody G19-4). Cells are lysed after 4 minutes or at another desired time by the addition of a lysis buffer containing NP-40 detergent. Phosphorylation of proteins is detected by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Detection of phosphorylation of specific proteins of interest such as ZAP-70 is detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-ZAP-70 antibody followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Such procedures are described in Schieven, G. L., Mittler, R. S., Nadler, S. G., Kirihara, J. M., Bolen, J. B., Kanner, S. B., and Ledbetter, J. A., “ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase, CD45 and T cell receptor involvement in UV and H2O2 induced T cell signal transduction”, J. Biol. Chem., 269, 20718-20726 (1994), and the references incorporated therein. The Lck inhibitors inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins induced by anti-CD3 antibodies.	For the preparation of G19-4, see Hansen, J. A., Martin, P. J., Beatty, P. G., Clark, E. A., and Ledbetter, J. A., “Human T lymphocyte cell surface molecules defined by the workshop monoclonal antibodies,” in Leukocyte Typing I, A. Bernard, J. Boumsell, J. Dausett, C. Milstein, and S. Schlossman, eds. (New York: Springer Verlag), p. 195-212 (1984); and Ledbetter, J. A., June, C. H., Rabinovitch, P. S., Grossman, A., Tsu, T. T., and Imboden, J. B., “Signal transduction through CD4 receptors: stimulatory vs. inhibitory activity is regulated by CD4 proximity to the CD3/T cell receptor”, Eur. J. Immunol., 18, 525 (1988).	Calcium Assay	Lck inhibitors block calcium mobilization in T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies. Cells are loaded with the calcium indicator dye indo-1, treated with anti-CD3 antibody such as the monoclonal antibody G19-4, and calcium mobilization is measured using flow cytometry by recording changes in the blue/violet indo-1 ratio as described in Schieven, G. L., Mittler, R. S., Nadler, S. G., Kirihara, J. M., Bolen, J. B., Kanner, S. B., and Ledbetter, J. A., “ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase, CD45 and T cell receptor involvement in UV and H2O2 induced T cell signal transduction”, J. Biol. Chem., 269, 20718-20726 (1994), and the references incorporated therein.	Proliferation Assays	Lck inhibitors inhibit the proliferation of normal human peripheral blood T cells stimulated to grow with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies. A 96 well plate is coated with a monoclonal antibody to CD3 (such as G19-4), the antibody is allowed to bind, and then the plate is washed. The antibody bound to the plate serves to stimulate the cells. Normal human peripheral blood T cells are added to the wells along with test compound plus anti-CD28 antibody to provide co-stimulation. After a desired period of time (e.g., 3 days), the [3H]-thymidine is added to the cells, and after further incubation to allow incorporation of the label into newly synthesized DNA, the cells are harvested and counted in a scintillation counter to measure cell proliferation.	SRC Kinase	The biochemical kinase assay to quantitate the inhibition of kinase activity by kinase inhibitors were performed in vitro in 96-well microtiter plates. All kinase inhibitors were dissolved in 100% DMSO and diluted into 2× the final concentration with PBS/1% DMSO prior to assay. Kinase reaction consisted of 5 ng of baculovirus expressed GST-SRC, 1.5 mM poly(Glu/Tyr) (Sigma), 0.3 mM ATP, and 0.15 mCi [g-33P]ATP in 50 ml kinase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.3 mM MnCl2). The reaction mixture was incubated at 28° C. for 1 hour. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 ml of stopping buffer consisting of 2.5 mg/ml BSA and 300 mM EDTA followed by immediate precipitation with 110 ml of 10% TCA on ice for 30 min. The precipitates were transferred to a 96-well UniFilter GF/C plate. The amount of the phosphorylated synthetic substrate was quantitated using a TopCount 96-well liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc, Boston, Mass.). Dose-response curves were generated to determine the concentration of the inhibitors required to inhibit 50% of kinase activity (IC50). IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis and have a coefficient of variance=16% (SD/mean, n=3). The reported IC50 value was the average from at least three separate experiments.	LCK Kinase	The same procedure as that of SRC kinase detailed above was applied to the LCK kinase assay, except that the reaction consisted of 20 ng baculovirus expressed GST-LCK protein.	YES Kinase	The same procedure as that of SRC kinase detailed above was applied to the YES kinase assay, except that the reaction consisted of 10 ng baculovirus expressed GST-YES protein.	FYN Kinase	The same procedure as that of SRC kinase detailed above was applied to the LCK kinase assay, except that the reaction consisted of 20 ng baculovirus expressed GST-FYN protein.	BCR-ABL Kinase	The same procedure as that of SRC kinase detailed above was applied to the BCR-ABL kinase assay, except that the reaction consisted of 250 ng baculovirus expressed GST-BCR-ABL protein.	c-KIT Kinase	The biochemical assay to determine inhibition of c-KIT kinase activity was performed as described in section 3.1.2.1, with the exception that each reaction mixture contained 250 ng of recombinant GST-c-KIT protein purified from Sf9 insect cells. The GST-c-KIT protein contains the entire cytoplasmic sequence of c-KIT. The mixture contained also 1.5 mM poly (Glu/Tyr) (Sigma), 1 M ATP, and 0.15 mCi[g-33P]ATP in 50 ml kinase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.7, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5 mM MgCl2). Incorporation of radioactive phosphate and the determination of IC50 values were also carried out as described above.	PDGF Receptor Kinase	The PDGFR-b human receptor tyrosine kinase was assayed using the synthetic polymer poly(Glu4/Tyr) (Sigma Chemicals) as a phosphoacceptor substrate. Each reaction mixture consisted of a total volume of 50 ml and contained 200 ng of baculovirus expressed enzyme, 64 mg/ml poly(Glu4/Tyr), 3.6 mM of ATP, and 0.7 mCi of [g-33P]ATP. The mixture also contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mM MnCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DDT, and 25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 27° C. for 60 minutes and kinase activity was determined by quantitation of the amount of radioactive phosphate transferred to the poly(Glu4/Tyr) substrate. Incorporation was measured by the addition of cold trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were collected onto GF/C UniFilter plates (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, Conn.) using a Filtermate universal harvester and quantitated using a TopCount 96-well liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, Conn.). Compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 10 mM and were evaluated at six concentrations diluted four-fold, each in triplicate. The final concentration of DMSO in the kinase assays was 0.5%, which was shown to have no effect on kinase activity. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis and have a coefficient of variance (SD/mean, n=6)=10%.	EPHA2 Receptor Kinase	The biochemical assay to determine inhibition of EPHA2 kinase activity was performed as described above, with the exception that each reaction mixture contained 100 ng of recombinant GST-EPHA2 protein purified from Sf9 insect cells. The GST-EphA2 protein consists of the entire cytoplasmic sequence of EPHA2 fused to the c-terminus of GST. The mixture contained also 1.5 mM poly (Glu/Tyr) (Sigma), 1 mM ATP, and 0.15 mCi[g-33P]ATP in 50 ml kinase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.7, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5 mM MgCl2). Incorporation of radioactive phosphate and the determination of IC50 values were also carried out as described above.	Methods of Preparation	
US20060069101_0006	The compounds of the formula (Ia), (Ib), and/or (Ic) may be prepared by methods such as those illustrated in the following Schemes 1-4. Solvents, temperatures, pressures, and other reaction conditions may readily be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. All documents cited are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Starting materials are commercially available or readily prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art. Constituents of compounds are as defined elsewhere in the specification or as specifically defined in a scheme.	The present invention is directed to prodrugs of compound (A). Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. For examples of such prodrug delivery derivatives, see:	a) Design of Prodrugs, H. Bundgaard (editor), Elsevier (1985);	b) Methods in Enzymology, K. Widder et al. (editors), Academic Press, Vol. 112, 309-396 (1985);	c) A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Krosgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard (editors), Chapter 5, “Design and Application of Prodrugs,” 113-191 (1991);	d) H. Bundgaard, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 8, 1-38 (1992);	e) H. Bundgaard, J. of Pharm. Sciences, 77, 285 (1988); and	f) N. Kakeya et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 32 692 (1984).	Various ester and carbonate prodrugs can be prepared by reacting alcohol 1 with acyl halides in the presence of base such as triethylamine and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine. Alternatively, esters can be obtained using the various acids in the presence of activating agents such as EDCI and 4-dimethylaminopyridine in a solvent like DMF or THF (Scheme 1).	Phosphate bis-sodium salt 9 can be prepared by coupling of alcohol 1 with di-t-butylphosphoramidite followed by mCPBA oxidation, deprotection of the t-butyls with TFA and salt formation using aq. NaOH solution (Scheme 2).	Carbamate prodrugs such as 11 or 12 can be prepared by reacting the silyl protected compound 10 with alkyl chloroformate in the presence of base such as pyridine and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine. Deprotection of the silyl group of the resulting carbamate with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride can provide the carbamate prodrugs (Scheme 3).	Ester prodrugs via the methylene linker on the nitrogen atom of the aminothiazole moiety can be prepared using the appropriate chloromethyloxycarbonyl alkyl or aryl derivatives in the presence of base such as cesium carbonate or sodium hydride followed by deprotection of the silyl group. Depending on the substrate alkylation can produce either the coupling adduct on the amino group such as analogues 13 and 14 as a very major or an adduct on the thiazole nitrogen such as 15 as a very major. In some cases coupling reaction provided a mixture of two region-isomers like 16 and 17 in a 5:3 ratio (Scheme 3).	Dioxalenone prodrug like 19 can be prepared by coupling of silyl ether 10 with 4-bromomethy-5-methyldioxalenone followed by deprotection of the silyl group to obtain prodrug 19 (Scheme 4).

US20070270434_0003	FIELD OF THE INVENTION	The present invention relates to novel sulfonyl-substituted, bicyclic aryl compounds, compositions comprising said compounds, and their application as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease. Methods of modulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are also provided, for the treatment of PPAR-mediated diseases including obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	Peroxisome proliferators are a structurally diverse group of compounds which, when administered to mammals, elicit dramatic increases in the size and number of hepatic and renal peroxisomes, as well as concomitant increases in the capacity of peroxisomes to metabolize fatty acids via increased expression of the enzymes required for the β-oxidation cycle (Lazarow and Fujiki, Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1:489-530 (1985); Vamecq and Draye, Essays Biochem. 24:1115-225 (1989); and Nelali et al., Cancer Res. 48:5316-5324 (1988)). Compounds that activate or otherwise interact with one or more of the PPARs have been implicated in the regulation of triglyceride and cholesterol levels in animal models. Compounds included in this group are the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs, herbicides, and phthalate plasticizers (Reddy and Lalwani, Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 12:1-58 (1983)). Peroxisome proliferation can also be elicited by dietary or physiological factors such as a high-fat diet and cold acclimatization.	Biological processes modulated by PPAR are those modulated by receptors, or receptor combinations, which are responsive to the PPAR receptor ligands. These processes include, for example, plasma lipid transport and fatty acid catabolism, regulation of insulin sensitivity and blood glucose levels, which are involved in hypoglycemia/hyperinsulinemia (resulting from, for example, abnormal pancreatic beta cell function, insulin secreting tumors and/or autoimmune hypoglycemia due to autoantibodies to insulin, the insulin receptor, or autoantibodies that are stimulatory to pancreatic beta cells), macrophage differentiation which lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, inflammatory response, carcinogenesis, hyperplasia, and adipocyte differentiation.	Subtypes of PPAR include PPAR-alpha, PPAR-delta (also known as NUC1, PPAR-beta and FAAR) and two isoforms of PPAR-gamma. These PPARs can regulate expression of target genes by binding to DNA sequence elements, termed PPAR response elements (PPRE). To date, PPRE's have been identified in the enhancers of a number of genes encoding proteins that regulate lipid metabolism suggesting that PPARs play a pivotal role in the adipogenic signaling cascade and lipid homeostasis (H. Keller and W. Wahli, Trends Endoodn. Met. 291-296, 4 (1993)).	Insight into the mechanism whereby peroxisome proliferators exert their pleiotropic effects was provided by the identification of a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily activated by these chemicals (Isseman and Green, Nature 347-645-650 (1990)). The receptor, termed PPAR-alpha (or alternatively, PPARα), was subsequently shown to be activated by a variety of medium and long-chain fatty acids and to stimulate expression of the genes encoding rat acyl-CoA oxidase and hydratase-dehydrogenase (enzymes required for peroxisomal β-oxidation), as well as rabbit cytochrome P450 4A6, a fatty acid ω-hydroxylase (Gottlicher et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:4653-4657 (1992); Tugwood et al., EMBO J 11:433-439 (1992); Bardot et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 192:37-45 (1993); Muerhoff et al., J Biol. Chem. 267:19051-19053 (1992); and Marcus et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 90(12):5723-5727 (1993).	Activators of the nuclear receptor PPAR-gamma (or alternatively, PPARγ), for example troglitazone, have been clinically shown to enhance insulin-action, to reduce serum glucose and to have small but significant effects on reducing serum triglyceride levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. See, for example, D. E. Kelly et al., Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes, 90-96, 5 (2), (1998); M. D. Johnson et al., Ann. Pharmacother., 337-348, 32 (3), (1997); and M. Leutenegger et al., Curr. Ther. Res., 403-416, 58 (7), (1997).	The third subtype of PPAR, PPAR-delta (or alternatively, PPARδ, PPARβ, or NUC1) initially received much less attention than the other PPARs because of its ubiquitous expression and the unavailability of selective ligands. However, genetic studies and recently developed synthetic PPAR-δ agonists have helped reveal its role as a powerful regulator of fatty acid catabolism and energy homeostasis. Studies in adipose tissue and muscle have begun to uncover the metabolic functions of PPAR-δ. Transgenic expression of an activated form of PPAR-δ in adipose tissue produces lean mice that are resistant to obesity, hyperlipidemia and tissue steatosis induced genetically or by a high-fat diet. The activated receptor induces genes required for fatty acid catabolism and adaptive thermogenesis. Interestingly, the transcription of PPAR-γ target genes for lipid storage and lipogenesis remain unchanged. In parallel, PPAR-δ-deficientmice challenged with a high-fat diet show reduced energy uncoupling and are prone to obesity. Together, these data identify PPAR-δ as a key regulator of fat-burning, a role that opposes the fat-storing function of PPAR-γ. Thus, despite their close evolutionary and structural kinship, PPAR-γ and PPAR-δ regulate distinct genetic networks. In skeletal muscle, PPAR-δ likewise upregulates fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure, to a far greater extent than does the lesser-expressed PPAR-α. (Evans R M et al 2004 Nature Med 1-7, 10 (4), 2004)	PPARδ is broadly expressed in the body and has been shown to be a valuable molecular target for treatment of dyslipidemia and other diseases. For example, in a recent study in insulin-resistant obese rhesus monkeys, a potent and selective PPARδ compound was shown to decrease VLDL and increase HDL in a dose response manner (Oliver et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98: 5305, 2001). Also, in a recent study in wild-type and HDL-lacking, ABCA1−/− mice, a different potent and selective PPARδ compound was shown to reduce fractional cholesterol absorption in the intestine, and coincidentally reduce expression of the cholesterol-absorption protein NPC1L1 (van der Veen et al., J. Lipid Res. 2005 46: 526-534).	Because there are three isoforms of PPAR and all of them have been shown to play important roles in energy homeostasis and other biological processes in human body, and have been shown to be important molecular targets for treatment of metabolic and other diseases (see Wilson, et al. J. Med. Chem. 43: 527-550 (2000)), it is desired in the art to identify compounds which are capable of interacting with multiple PPAR isoforms or compounds which are capable of selectively interacting with only one of the PPAR isoforms. Such compounds would find a wide variety of uses, such as, for example, in the treatment or prevention of obesity, for the treatment or prevention of diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome X and other uses.	Several PPAR-modulating drugs have been approved for use in humans. Fenofibrate and gemfibrozil are PPARα modulators; pioglitazone (Actos, Takeda Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly) and rosiglitazone (Avandia, GlaxoSmithKline) are PPARγ modulators. All of these compounds have liabilities as potential carcinogens, however, having been demonstrated to have proliferative effects leading to cancers of various types (colon; bladder with PPARα modulators and liver with PPARγ modulators) in rodent studies. Therefore, a need exists to identify modulators of PPARs that lack these liabilities.	Additionally, recent evidence points to a role for PPAR-δ in the development of cancers, including colon, skin, and lung cancers. Modulators of PPAR could therefore find use in the treatment of cancers of various types.

The degree of selectivity may vary, but as an example, in certain embodiments, a selective compound would be at least tenfold selective for the desired target (e.g., PPARδ). In further embodiments, the compound would be 100- to 1000-fold selective, or more. Alternatively, a compound may be selective the sense of producing a differential effect. For example, such a compound may bind both PPAR and GPR40 with equal or similar affinity, but activate one while inhibiting the other.	The phrase “therapeutically effective” is intended to qualify the amount of active ingredients used in the treatment of a disease or disorder. This amount will achieve the goal of reducing or eliminating the said disease or disorder. In reference to the treatment of diabetes or dyslipidemia a therapeutically effective amount may refer to that amount which has the effect of (1) reducing the blood glucose levels; (2) normalizing lipids, e.g. triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein; (3) relieving to some extent (or eliminating) one or more symptoms associated with the disease, condition or disorder to be treated; and/or (4) raising HDL.	As used herein, reference to “treatment” of a patient is intended to include prophylaxis. The term “patient” means all mammals including humans. Examples of patients include humans, cows, dogs, cats, goats, sheep, pigs, and rabbits. In certain embodiments, the patient is a human.	The term “combination therapy” means the administration of two or more therapeutic agents to treat a therapeutic condition or disorder described in the present disclosure. Such administration encompasses co-administration of these therapeutic agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single capsule having a fixed ratio of active ingredients or in multiple, separate capsules for each active ingredient. In addition, such administration also encompasses use of each type of therapeutic agent in a sequential manner. In either case, the treatment regimen will provide beneficial effects of the drug combination in treating the conditions or disorders described herein.	The term “prodrug” refers to a compound that is made more active in vivo. The present compounds can also exist as prodrugs, as described in Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Enzymology (Testa, Bernard and Mayer, Joachim M. Wiley-VHCA, Zurich, Switzerland 2003). Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are structurally modified forms of the compound that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compound. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compound by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to a compound when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the compound, or parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. A wide variety of prodrug derivatives are known in the art, such as those that rely on hydrolytic cleavage or oxidative activation of the prodrug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”), but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity. Additional examples include peptidyl derivatives of a compound. The term “therapeutically acceptable prodrug,” refers to those prodrugs or zwitterions which are suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, and allergic response, are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and are effective for their intended use.	The term “therapeutically acceptable salt,” as used herein, represents salts or zwitterionic forms of the compounds of the present invention which are water or oil-soluble or dispersible; which are suitable for treatment of diseases without undue toxicity, irritation, and allergic-response; which are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio; and which are effective for their intended use. The salts can be prepared during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or separately by reacting the appropriate compound in the form of the free base with a suitable acid.	Representative acid addition salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, L-ascorbate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate (besylate), bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, digluconate, formate, fumarate, gentisate, glutarate, glycerophosphate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate(isethionate), lactate, maleate, malonate, DL-mandelate, mesitylenesulfonate, methanesulfonate, naphthylenesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylproprionate, phosphonate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, pyroglutamate, succinate, sulfonate, tartrate, L-tartrate, trichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, para-toluenesulfonate (p-tosylate), and undecanoate. Also, basic groups in the compounds of the present invention can be quaternized with methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides; dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates; decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and steryl chlorides, bromides, and iodides; and benzyl and phenethyl bromides. Examples of acids which can be employed to form therapeutically acceptable addition salts include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, and phosphoric, and organic acids such as oxalic, maleic, succinic, and citric. Salts can also be formed by coordination of the compounds with an alkali metal or alkaline earth ion. Hence, the present invention contemplates sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium salts of the compounds of the compounds of the present invention and the like.	Basic addition salts can be prepared during the final isolation and purification of the compounds by reacting a carboxy group with a suitable base such as the hydroxide, carbonate, or bicarbonate of a metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary, secondary, or tertiary amine. The cations of therapeutically acceptable salts include lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum, as well as nontoxic quaternary amine cations such as ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, diethylamine, ethylamine, tributylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N-methylpiperidine, N-methylmorpholine, dicyclohexylamine, procaine, dibenzylamine, N,N-dibenzylphenethylamine, 1-ephenamine, and N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine. Other representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine, and piperazine.	The compounds of the present invention can exist as therapeutically acceptable salts. The present invention includes compounds listed above in the form of salts, in particular acid addition salts. Suitable salts include those formed with both organic and inorganic acids. Such acid addition salts will normally be pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be of utility in the preparation and purification of the compound in question. For a more complete discussion of the preparation and selection of salts, refer to Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use (Stahl, P. Heinrich. Wiley-VCHA, Zurich, Switzerland, 2002).	Thus, salts include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfonate, citrate, tartrate, phosphonate, lactate, pyruvate, acetate, succinate, oxalate, fumarate, malate, oxaloacetate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate and isethionate salts of the compounds of the present invention. The salts can be prepared by contacting the compounds of the invention with an appropriate acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent, to yield the salt forms of the invention. In certain embodiments, the p-toluenesulfonate (tosylate) is used with the disclosed compounds.	While it may be possible for the compounds of the subject invention to be administered as the raw chemical, it is also possible to present them as a pharmaceutical formulation. Accordingly, the subject invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug or solvate thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. Any of the well-known techniques, carriers, and excipients may be used as suitable and as understood in the art; e.g., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured in a manner that is itself known, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or compression processes.	The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarticular, and intramedullary), intraperitoneal, transmucosal, transdermal, rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular) administration although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of the subject invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug or solvate thereof (“active ingredient”) with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.	Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.	Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include tablets, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. Tablets may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with binders, inert diluents, or lubricating, surface active or dispersing agents. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.	The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in powder form or in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or sterile pyrogen-free water, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.	Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous (oily) sterile injection solutions of the active compounds which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.	In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.	For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, pastilles, or gels formulated in conventional manner. Such compositions may comprise the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth.	The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, or other glycerides.	Compounds of the present invention may be administered topically, that is by non-systemic administration. This includes the application of a compound of the present invention externally to the epidermis or the buccal cavity and the instillation of such a compound into the ear, eye and nose, such that the compound does not significantly enter the blood stream. In contrast, systemic administration refers to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration.	Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of inflammation such as gels, liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear or nose. The active ingredient for topical administration may comprise, for example, from 0.001% to 10% w/w (by weight) of the formulation. In certain embodiments, the active ingredient may comprise as much as 10% w/w. In other embodiments, it may comprise less than 5% w/w. In certain embodiments, the active ingredient may comprise from 2% w/w to 5% w/w. In other embodiments, it may comprise from 0.1% to 1% w/w of the formulation.	Gels for topical or transdermal administration of compounds of the subject invention may comprise, generally, a mixture of volatile solvents, nonvolatile solvents, and water. In certain embodiments, the volatile solvent component of the buffered solvent system may include lower (C1-C6) alkyl alcohols, lower alkyl glycols and lower glycol polymers. In further embodiments, the volatile solvent is ethanol. The volatile solvent component is thought to act as a penetration enhancer, while also producing a cooling effect on the skin as it evaporates. The nonvolatile solvent portion of the buffered solvent system is selected from lower alkylene glycols and lower glycol polymers. In certain embodiments, propylene glycol is used. The nonvolatile solvent slows the evaporation of the volatile solvent and reduces the vapor pressure of the buffered solvent system. The amount of this nonvolatile solvent component, as with the volatile solvent, is determined by the pharmaceutical compound or drug being used. When too little of the nonvolatile solvent is in the system, the pharmaceutical compound may crystallize due to evaporation of volatile solvent, while an excess may result in a lack of bioavailability due to poor release of drug from solvent mixture. The buffer component of the buffered solvent system may be selected from any buffer commonly used in the art; in certain embodiments, water is used. A common ratio of ingredients is about 20% of the nonvolatile solvent, about 40% of the volatile solvent, and about 40% water. There are several optional ingredients which can be added to the topical composition. These include, but are not limited to, chelators and gelling agents. Appropriate gelling agents can include, but are not limited to, semisynthetic cellulose derivatives (such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) and synthetic polymers, and cosmetic agents.	Lotions according to the present invention include those suitable for application to the skin or eye. An eye lotion may comprise a sterile aqueous solution optionally containing a bactericide and may be prepared by methods similar to those for the preparation of drops. Lotions or liniments for application to the skin may also include an agent to hasten drying and to cool the skin, such as an alcohol or acetone, and/or a moisturizer such as glycerol or an oil such as castor oil or arachis oil.	Creams, ointments or pastes according to the present invention are semi-solid formulations of the active ingredient for external application. They may be made by mixing the active ingredient in finely-divided or powdered form, alone or in solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous fluid, with the aid of suitable machinery, with a greasy or non-greasy base. The base may comprise hydrocarbons such as hard, soft or liquid paraffin, glycerol, beeswax, a metallic soap; a mucilage; an oil of natural origin such as almond, corn, arachis, castor or olive oil; wool fat or its derivatives or a fatty acid such as steric or oleic acid together with an alcohol such as propylene glycol or a macrogel. The formulation may incorporate any suitable surface active agent such as an anionic, cationic or non-ionic surfactant such as a sorbitan ester or a polyoxyethylene derivative thereof. Suspending agents such as natural gums, cellulose derivatives or inorganic materials such as silicaceous silicas, and other ingredients such as lanolin, may also be included.	Drops according to the present invention may comprise sterile aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions and may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a suitable aqueous solution of a bactericidal and/or fungicidal agent and/or any other suitable preservative, and, in certain embodiments, including a surface active agent. The resulting solution may then be clarified by filtration, transferred to a suitable container which is then sealed and sterilized by autoclaving or maintaining at 98-100° C. for half an hour. Alternatively, the solution may be sterilized by filtration and transferred to the container by an aseptic technique. Examples of bactericidal and fungicidal agents suitable for inclusion in the drops are phenylmercuric nitrate or acetate (0.002%), benzalkonium chloride (0.01%) and chlorhexidine acetate (0.01%). Suitable solvents for the preparation of an oily solution include glycerol, diluted alcohol and propylene glycol.	Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.	For administration by inhalation the compounds according to the invention are conveniently delivered from an insufflator, nebulizer pressurized packs or other convenient means of delivering an aerosol spray. Pressurized packs may comprise a suitable propellant such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Alternatively, for administration by inhalation or insufflation, the compounds according to the invention may take the form of a dry powder composition, for example a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The powder composition may be presented in unit dosage form, in for example, capsules, cartridges, gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may be administered with the aid of an inhalator or insufflator.	Unit dosage formulations include those containing an effective dose, as herein below recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.	It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.	The compounds of the invention may be administered orally or via injection at a dose of from 0.1 to 500 mg/kg per day. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 5 mg to 2 g/day. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units may conveniently contain an amount of compound of the invention which is effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5 mg to 500 mg, usually around 10 mg to 200 mg.	The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.	The compounds of the subject invention can be administered in various modes, e.g. orally, topically, or by injection. The precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. The specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diets, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the precise disorder being treated, and the severity of the indication or condition being treated. Also, the route of administration may vary depending on the condition and its severity.	In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one of the compounds described herein (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or prodrug thereof) in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein is hypertension, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-hypertensive agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may only have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit of experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. By way of example only, in a treatment for diabetes involving administration of one of the compounds described herein, increased therapeutic benefit may result by also providing the patient with another therapeutic agent for diabetes. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit.	Specific, non-limiting examples of possible combination therapies include use of the compound of formula (I) with: (a) statin and/or other lipid lowering drugs for example MTP inhibitors and LDLR upregulators; (b) antidiabetic agents, e.g. metformin, sulfonylureas, or PPAR-gamma, PPAR-alpha and PPAR-alpha/gamma modulators (for example thiazolidinediones such as e.g. Pioglitazone and Rosiglitazone); and (c) antihypertensive agents such as angiotensin antagonists, e.g., telmisartan, calcium channel antagonists, e.g. lacidipine and ACE inhibitors, e.g., enalapril.	For the treatment of opthalmologic disorders and diseases of the eye, compounds according to the present invention may be administered with an agent selected from the group comprising: nitric oxide synthase inhibitors including inhibitors of inducible nitric oxide synthase; inhibitors of p38 kinase; beta-blockers including timolol, betaxolol, levobetaxolol, carteolol, levobunolol, and propranolol; carbonic anhydrase inhibitors including brinzolamide and dorzolamide; α- and β-adrenergic antagonists including α1-adrenergic antagonists such as nipradilol and α2 agonists such as iopidine and brimonidine; miotics including pilocarpine and epinephrine; prostaglandin analogs including latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, and unoprostone; corticosteroids including dexamethasone, prednisone, and methylprednisolone; and immunosuppressant agents including azathioprine, cyclosporine, and immunoglobulins.	In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (at least one of which is a compound of the present invention) may be administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents may be provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may be any duration of time ranging from a few minutes to four weeks.	Thus, in another aspect, the present invention provides methods for treating PPAR-mediated disorders in a human or animal subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to said subject an amount of a compound of the present invention effective to reduce or prevent said disorder in the subject in combination with at least one additional agent for the treatment of said disorder that is known in the art. In a related aspect, the present invention provides therapeutic compositions comprising at least one compound of the present invention in combination with one or more additional agents for the treatment of PPAR-mediated disorders.

Biological Activity Assay	Compounds may be screened for functional potency in transient transfection assays in CV-1 cells for their ability to activate the PPAR subtypes (transactivation assay). A previously established chimeric receptor system was utilized to allow comparison of the relative transcriptional activity of the receptor subtypes on the same synthetic response element and to prevent endogenous receptor activation from complicating the interpretation of results. See, for example, Lehmann, J. M.; Moore, L. B.; Smith-Oliver, T. A; Wilkinson, W. O.; Willson, T. M.; Kliewer, S. A., An antidiabetic thiazolidinedione is a high affinity ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 6 (PPARδ), J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 12953-6. The ligand binding domains for murine and human PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma, and PPAR-delta are each fused to the yeast transcription factor GAL4 DNA binding domain. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for the respective PPAR chimera along with a reporter construct containing four or five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding site driving expression of luciferase. After 8-16 h, the cells are replated into multi-well assay plates and the media is exchanged to phenol-red free DME medium supplemented with 5% delipidated calf serum. 4 hours after replating, cells were treated with either compounds or 1% DMSO for 20-24 hours. Luciferase activity was then assayed with Britelite (Perkin Elmer) following the manufacturer's protocol and measured with either the Perkin Elmer Viewlux or Molecular Devices Acquest (see, for example, Kliewer, S. A., et. al. Cell 1995, 83, 813-819). Rosiglitazone is used as a positive control in the PPARγ assay. Wy-14643 and GW7647 are used as positive controls in the PPARα assay. GW501516 is used as the positive control in the PPARδ assay.

The present invention concerns 5,6-dihydropyrazolo[3,4-e][1,4]diazepin-4(1H)-one derivatives having pharmaceutical activity, to processes for preparing such derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such derivatives and to the use of such derivatives as active therapeutic agents.	Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) work by converting cAMP or cGMP to AMP and GMP, or the inactive nucleotide forms incapable of activating downstream signalling pathways. The inhibition of PDEs leads to the accumulation of cAMP or cGMP, and subsequent activation of downstream pathways. PDEs comprise a large family of second messengers with 11 families and over 50 isoforms. In addition splice variants have been described for each isoform. The PDEs can be cAMP-specific (PDE4, 7, 8, 10), cGMP specific (PDE5, 6, 9) or have dual specificity (PDE1, 2, 3, 11).	cAMP is generated from ATP at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane through the action of GPCR-regulated adenylate cyclase. Once cAMP is generated, the only way to terminate the signal is through phosphodiesterase action, degrading cAMP into 5′-AMP. Increased concentrations of cAMP are translated into cellular responses mainly by activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The specific activity of PKA is in part regulated by the sub-cellular localization of PKA, which limits the phosphorylation of PKA to substrates in its near vicinity. The downstream events caused by activation of PKA appear poorly elucidated and involve many components in the initiation of signalling cascades. PDE4s have been shown to have abundant roles in regulating cell desensitisation, adaptation, signal cross-talk, cAMP compartmentalization and feedback loops, and are major regulators of cAMP homeostasis.	The physiological role implicated for elevated cAMP levels include: 1) broad suppression of the activity of many immunocompetent cells; 2) induction of airway smooth muscle relaxation; 3) suppression of smooth muscle mitogenesis; and, 4) has beneficial modulatory effects on the activity of pulmonary nerves.	PDE4 has been found to be the predominant cAMP metabolising isozyme family in immune and inflammatory cells and, along with the PDE3 family, a major contributor to cAMP metabolism in airway smooth muscle.	Over the last two decades significant attention has been devoted into the development of PDE4 selective inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders including asthma, rhinitis, bronchitis, COPD, arthritis and psoriasis. A number of compounds (for example rolipram, tibenelast and denbufylline) have been reported to have impressive effects in animal models of inflammation, especially pulmonary inflammation.	Unfortunately the clinical utility of these inhibitors has been limited by PDE4 related side-effects, including nausea, vomiting and gastric acid secretion. Recently a second generation of PDE4 inhibitors (for example cilomilast, roflumilast and AWD 12-281) has been described having significantly reduced risk of emetic side effects in animal models of emesis, thus providing the potential for an increased therapeutic ratio.	The present invention discloses novel amino pyridine sulphonamide derivatives that are inhibitors of human PDE4 and are thereby useful in therapy.	Pyrazolo[4,3-e]diazepine derivatives that are useful as PDE4 inhibitors are disclosed in WO 01/49689.

Compounds of formula (II) wherein X is a Cl or OH and R1 and R2 are as defined in formula (I), can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (IV):	wherein R1 and R2 are as defined in formula (I), and R29 is C1-6 alkyl, the process being carried out at a suitable temperature, generally between 50° C. and 80° C., in a suitable mixture of solvents such as ethanol/water in the presence of a suitable base, e.g. NaOH. The resulting product, where X is OH according to formula (II), could be reacted further by treating with thionyl chloride in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane at a suitable temperature, generally reflux temperature of the solvent, delivering compounds according to formula (II) where X is Cl. Alternatively, the resulting product, where X is OH according to formula (II), could be reacted further by treating with a suitable coupling agent such as O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane at a suitable temperature, between 20° C. and 90° C., delivering compounds according to formula (II) where X is [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-3-ol.

Compounds of formula (I) in free or salt form can be isolated from reaction mixtures and purified in conventional manner.	Compounds of formula (III) are either commercially available or may be prepared by known methods.	Compounds of formula (V) may be prepared by the method described in Heterocyclic Chemistry, 15 (1), 2004, 67, or analogously.	Compounds of formula (VI) are either commercially available or may be prepared by known methods.	The preparations of various intermediates are described in the literature or can be prepared by routine adaptation of methods described in the literature.	In the above processes it may be desirable or necessary to protect an acid group or a hydroxy or other potentially reactive group. Suitable protecting groups and details of processes for adding and removing such groups may be found in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, 3rd Edition (1999) by Greene and Wuts.	In another aspect the present invention provides processes for the preparation of compounds of formula (I).

A compound of formula (VII) can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II), wherein X is OH, with 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAT) in the presence of a suitable coupling agent (such as HATU), in the presence of a suitable base (such as a tertiary C1-6 alkyl alkyl amine, for example N,N-diisopropylethylamine) in a suitable solvent (such as dichloromethane) at ambient temperature (that is 5 to 35° C.).	The advantage of the process of preparing a compound of formula (Ia) from a compound of formula (VII) is that the compound of formula (VII) (which is a reactive intermediate) can be isolated and purified thereby reducing extensive decarboxylation that can occur during workup or subsequent cyclisation in the presence of impurities or strong acids (such as hydrochloric acid). The use of microwaves further improves the yields compared to traditional heating.

CROSS REFERENCE	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 60/965,931, filed Aug. 22, 2007, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.	BACKGROUND	Neurotransmitters and hormones, as well as other types of extracellular signals such as light and odors, create intracellular signals by altering the amounts of cyclic nucleotide monophosphates (cAMP and cGMP) within cells. These intracellular messengers alter the functions of many intracellular proteins. Cyclic AMP regulates the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA phosphorylates and regulates the function of many types of proteins, including ion channels, enzymes, and transcription factors. Downstream mediators of cGMP signaling also include kinases and ion channels. In addition to actions mediated by kinases, cAMP and cGMP bind directly to some cell proteins and directly regulate their activities.	Cyclic nucleotides are produced from the actions of adenylyl cyclase and guanylyl cyclase, which convert ATP to cAMP and GTP to cGMP. Extracellular signals, often through the actions of G protein-coupled receptors, regulate the activities of the cyclases. Alternatively, the amount of cAMP and cGMP may be altered by regulating the activities of the enzymes that degrade cyclic nucleotides. Cell homeostasis is maintained by the rapid degradation of cyclic nucleotides after stimulus-induced increases. The enzymes that degrade cyclic nucleotides are called 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs).	Eleven PDE gene families (PDE1-PDE11) have been identified based on their distinct amino acid sequences, catalytic and regulatory characteristics, and sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors. These families are coded for by 21 genes; and further multiple splice variants are transcribed from many of these genes. Expression patterns of each of the gene families are distinct. PDEs differ with respect to their affinity for cAMP and cGMP. Activities of different PDEs are regulated by different signals. For example, PDE1 is stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin. PDE2 activity is stimulated by cGMP. PDE3 is inhibited by cGMP. PDE4 is cAMP specific and is specifically inhibited by rolipram. PDE5 is cGMP-specific. PDE6 is expressed in retina.	PDE10 sequences were identified by using bioinformatics and sequence information from other PDE gene families (Fujishige et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:18438-18445, 1999; Loughney et al., Gene 234:109-117, 1999; Soderling et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:7071-7076, 1999). The PDE10 gene family is distinguished based on its amino acid sequence, functional properties and tissue distribution. The human PDE10 gene is large, over 200 kb, with up to 24 exons coding for each of the splice variants. The amino acid sequence is characterized by two GAF domains (which bind cGMP), a catalytic region, and alternatively spliced N and C termini. Numerous splice variants are possible because at least three alternative exons encode N termini and two exons encode C-termini. PDE10A1 is a 779 amino acid protein that hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP. The Km values for cAMP and cGMP are 0.05 and 3.0 micromolar, respectively. In addition to human variants, several variants with high homology have been isolated from both rat and mouse tissues and sequence banks.	PDE10 RNA transcripts were initially detected in human testis and brain. Subsequent immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the highest levels of PDE10 are expressed in the basal ganglia. Specifically, striatal neurons in the olfactory tubercle, caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens are enriched in PDE10. Western blots did not reveal the expression of PDE10 in other brain tissues, although immunoprecipitation of the PDE10 complex was possible in hippocampal and cortical tissues. This suggests that the expression level of PDE10 in these other tissues is 100-fold less than in striatal neurons. Expression in hippocampus is limited to the cell bodies, whereas PDE10 is expressed in terminals, dendrites and axons of striatal neurons.	The tissue distribution of PDE10 indicates that PDE10 inhibitors can be used to raise levels of cAMP and/or cGMP within cells that express the PDE10 enzyme, for example, in neurons that comprise the basal ganglia and therefore would be useful in treating a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions involving the basal ganglia such as obesity, non-insulin dependent diabetes, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and the like.

Certain compounds of Formula (I) can exist as tautomers and/or geometric isomers. All possible tautomers and cis and trans isomers, as individual forms and mixtures thereof, are within the scope of this invention. It should be noted that compounds of the invention may contain groups that may exist in tautomeric forms, such as cyclic and acyclic amidine and guanidine groups, heteroatom substituted heteroaryl groups (Y′═O, S, NR), and the like, which are illustrated in the following examples:	and though one form is named, described, displayed and/or claimed herein, all the tautomeric forms are intended to be inherently included in such name, description, display and/or claim.	Additionally, as used herein, the term “alkyl” includes all the possible isomeric forms of said alkyl group albeit only a few examples are set forth. Furthermore, when a cyclic group, such as aryl, heteroaryl, and heterocyclyl, is substituted, it includes all the positional isomers albeit only a few examples are set forth.	All polymorphic forms and solvates, including hydrates, of a compound of Formula (I) are also within the scope of this invention.	“Oxo” means the ═(O) group.	“Optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may but need not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, “heterocyclyl group optionally mono- or di-substituted with an alkyl group” means that the alkyl may but need not be present, and the description includes situations where the heterocyclyl group is mono- or disubstituted with an alkyl group and situations where the heterocyclyl group is not substituted with the alkyl group.	“Optionally substituted phenyl” means a phenyl ring optionally substituted with one, two, or three substituents, each independently selected from alkyl, halo, alkoxy, alkylthio, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, hydroxy, cyano, aminocarbonyl, acylamino, sulfonyl, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminoalkyl, alkoxycarbonyl, carboxy, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkoxy, cycloalkylalkyloxy, sulfinyl, and sulfonyl, each as defined herein.	“Optionally substituted heteroaryl” means a monovalent monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic radical of 5 to 10 ring atoms, where one or more, preferably one, two, or three ring atoms are heteroatoms, each independently selected from N, O, and S, and the remaining ring atoms are carbon that is optionally substituted with one, two, or three substituents, each independently selected from alkyl, halo, alkoxy, alkylthio, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, hydroxy, cyano, aminocarbonyl, acylamino, sulfonyl, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminoalkyl, alkoxycarbonyl, carboxy, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkoxy, cycloalkylalkyloxy, sulfinyl, and sulfonyl, each as defined herein.

US20090062291_0008	Treatment of 2-aminoacetophenone 2 with sodium nitrite in concentrated hydrochloric acid and water provides diazo compound intermediates that cyclize upon heating to provide 4-hydroxycinnolines 3. Treatment of 3 with either phosphorous oxychloride or phosphorous oxybromide provides the corresponding chloro or bromo compound of formula 1. The chloro derivative can be prepared by heating 2 in neat phosphorous oxychloride, followed by recrystallization of the product after neutralization (see, for example, Castle et al., J. Org. Chem. 17:1571, 1952). The bromo derivative can be prepared by mixing a concentrated suspension of the 4-hydroxycinnoline 3 in chloroform and phosphorous oxybromide at room temperature and then warming to reflux for 8 to 16 h. Extractive workup after neutralization and subsequent recrystallization from alcoholic solvent such as ethanol provides 4-bromocinnoline.	Compounds of formula 2 are either commercially available or can be synthesized by methods well known in the art. For example, compounds of formula 2 where R1 and R2 are same can be prepared by treating 3,4-dihydroxy-acetophenone with the desired R1LG reagent where R1 is as defined above and LG is a suitable leaving group in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate, triethylamine, sodium hydride, potassium carbonate, potassium hydride, and the like to provide the dialkylated product. Suitable organic solvents include acetone, acetonitrile, DMF, THF, and the like. 2-Amino-4,5-disubstituted acetophenones 2 is then prepared by nitration of 4,5-disubstituted acetophenones obtained from above with nitric acid in one of several solvents including acetic acid or sulfuric acid at ice bath temperatures to provide the corresponding 2-nitro-4,5-disubstituted acetophenones (see Mitzuta et al., Bioorg. AMed. Chem. 10:675-683, 2002). Reduction of the nitro group under known reaction conditions e.g., hydrogenation with palladium on carbon, iron powder in acetic acid, or nickel boride, among others, provides the desired compound 2. (see Castle et al., J. Org. Chem. 19:1117, 1954).	Compounds of formula 2 where R1 and R2 are different can be prepared by selectively protecting 3,4-dihydroxyacetophenone the 4-hydroxy group as its 4-benzyl ether (see Greenspan et al., J. Med. Chem. 42:164, 1999) by treatment with benzyl bromide and lithium carbonate in DMF solution. Functionalization of the 3-OH group with the desired R1LG where R1 and LG are as defined above can be accomplished under the alkylation conditions described above, including Mitsunobu reaction. Removal of the benzyl ether by hydrogenolysis with palladium on carbon in alcoholic solvents such as methanol and followed by alkylation of the 4-OH yields with the desired R2LG group would provide the desired 3,4-disubstitutedacetophenones, which upon nitration, followed by reduction of the nitro group provides the desired compound 2.	Compounds of formula 1 where X and Z are nitrogen, Y is carbon, and R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined in the Detailed Description of the Invention can be prepared as described below.	Reaction of 2-aminobenzamide compounds of formula 5 with trimethyl orthoformate or 2-aminobenzoic ester compounds of formula 6 with formamide in the presence of a base such as ammonium carbonate provides the corresponding 4-hydroxyquinazolone 7 which upon treatment with either phosphorous oxychloride or phosphorous oxybromide provides the corresponding chloro or bromo compound of formula 1. The chloro derivative may be prepared by heating 7 in neat phosphorous oxychloride, followed by recrystallization of the product after neutralization (see, for example, Castle et al., J. Org. Chem. 17:1571, 1952). The bromo derivative may be prepared by mixing a concentrated suspension of the 4-hydroxyquinazoline 7 in chloroform and phosphorous oxybromide at room temperature and then warming to reflux for 8 to 16 h. Extractive workup after neutralization and subsequent recrystallization from alcoholic solvent such as ethanol provides 4-bromoquinazoline 1. Compound 1 is then converted to a compound of Formula (I) as described in Scheme 1 above. Compounds of formula 5 and 6 are either commercially available or can be synthesized by methods common to the art.	Compounds of formula 1 where Y and Z are nitrogen, X is carbon, and R1, R2, and R3 are as defined in the Detailed Description of the Invention can be prepared as described as shown below.	Treatment of a compound of formula 10 with aqueous formaldehyde and hydrochloric acid provides the cyclized ester 11. Compounds of formula 10 are either commercially available (e.g., 3,4-dimethoxy benzoic acid) or can be synthesized by methods common to the art (see, for example, Napoletano et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 11:33-37, 2001). Oxidation of 11 with a suitable oxidizing agent such as perbenzoic acid in the presence of N-bromosuccinimide, followed by treatment with hydrazine, provides 4-hydroxy phthalazines 13. Treatment of 13 with phosphorous oxyhalide or with triflic anhydride as described in Scheme 1 above provides the 4-halo phthalazines 1. Compound 1 is then converted to compound of Formula (I) where Y and Z are nitrogen and X is —CH═ as described in Scheme 1 above.	Compounds of Formula (I), where X is nitrogen, Y and Z are —CH═, and R1, R2, R3 and R3a are as defined in the Detailed Description of the Invention, can be prepared as described in Scheme 3 below (see, J. Med. Chem., 42:5369, 1999).	Compounds 14, where R3 is hydrogen, and R1 and R2 are the same and are selected from alkoxy, hydroxy, for example, methoxy, can be synthesized by methods common to the art. For example, 3,4-dihydroxy-nitrobenzene 14 (R3═H, R3═R2═OH) can be treated with a desired R1LG, where R1 is as defined above and LG is a suitable leaving group, in the presence of a base, such as cesium carbonate, triethylamine, sodium hydride, potassium carbonate, potassium hydride, or the like, to provide the corresponding dialkoxy product. Suitable organic solvents include acetone, acetonitrile, DMF, THF, and the like. Reduction of the nitro group under known reaction conditions, e.g., hydrogenation with palladium on carbon, iron powder in acetic acid, or nickel boride, provides the amino compound 15 (see, Castle et al., J. Org. Chem. 19:1117, 1954).	Compounds 15, where R3 is hydrogen, R2 is hydroxy, and R1 is methoxy, can be prepared from 2-methoxy-5-nitrophenol as a starting material. Heating compound 15 with diethyl 2-(ethoxymethylene)malonate in the presence of diphenylether provides 4-hydroxyquinoline 16, which is then converted to 4-halo compound 1. Compound 1 is converted to a compound of Formula (I) as described in Scheme 1 above.	Compounds of formula 1, where Z is nitrogen; and X and Y are —CH═ and R1, R2, and R3 are as defined in the Detailed Description of the Invention, can be prepared as described below.	Treatment of acrylic acid derivative 17 with a halogenating agent, such as thionyl chloride, followed by treatment with sodium azide, provides acryloyl azide, which upon heating at approximately 270° C. in a suitable high boiling solvent, such as diphenylether, cyclizes to form the corresponding 2H-isoquinolin-1-one 18. Compounds of formula 17 are either commercially available or can be synthesized by methods common to the art. Compound 18 is then converted to compound 1, where LG is chloro or bromo, by treatment with phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorous oxybromide, respectively. Compound 1 is converted into a compound of Formula (I) as described in Scheme 1 above.	Utility and Methods of Use	Provided herein are methods for treating a disorder or disease by inhibiting PDE10 enzyme. The methods, in general, comprises the step of administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), or an individual stereoisomer, a mixture of stereoisomers, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, to a patient in need thereof to treat the disorder or disease.	In certain embodiments, this invention provides a use of a compound as described herein in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a disorder or disease treatable by inhibition of PDE10.	The compounds of the present invention inhibit PDE10 enzyme activity, and hence raise the levels of cAMP or cGMP within cells that express PDE10. Accordingly, inhibition of PDE10 enzyme activity would be useful in the treatment of diseases caused by deficient amounts of cAMP or cGMP in cells. PDE10 inhibitors would also be of benefit in cases wherein raising the amount of cAMP or cGMP above normal levels results in a therapeutic effect. Inhibitors of PDE10 may be used to treat disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, gastro-enterological diseases, endocrinological diseases and urological diseases.	Indications that may be treated with PDE10 inhibitors, either alone or in combination with other drugs, include, but are not limited to, those diseases thought to be mediated in part by the basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. These indications include psychoses, Parkinson's disease, dementias, obsessive compulsive disorder, tardive dyskinesia, choreas, depression, mood disorders, impulsivity, drug addiction, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression with parkinsonian states, personality changes with caudate or putamen disease, dementia and mania with caudate and pallidal diseases, and compulsions with pallidal disease.	Psychoses are disorders that affect an individual's perception of reality. Psychoses are characterized by delusions and hallucinations. The compounds of the present invention are suitable for use in treating patients suffering from all forms of psychoses, including, but not limited to, schizophrenia, late-onset schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, prodromal schizophrenia, and bipolar disorders. Treatment can be for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia as well as for the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms. Other indications for PDE10 inhibitors include psychoses resulting from drug abuse (including amphetamines and PCP), encephalitis, alcoholism, epilepsy, Lupus, sarcoidosis, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, dementia with Lewy bodies, or hypoglycemia. Other psychiatric disorders, like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizoid personality can also be treated with PDE10 inhibitors.	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been linked to deficits in the frontal-striatal neuronal pathways (Saxena et al., Br. J. Psychiatry Suppl, 35:26-37, 1998). Neurons in these pathways project to striatal neurons that express PDE10. PDE10 inhibitors cause cAMP to be elevated in these neurons; elevations in cAMP result in an increase in CREB phosphorylation and thereby improve the functional state of these neurons. The compounds of the present invention are therefore suitable for use in the indication of OCD. OCD may result, in some cases, from streptococcal infections that cause autoimmune reactions in the basal ganglia (Giedd et al., Am J Psychiatry. 157:281-283, 2000). Because PDE10 inhibitors may serve a neuroprotective role, administration of PDE10 inhibitors may prevent the damage to the basal ganglia after repeated streptococcal infections and thereby prevent the development of OCD.	In the brain, the level of CAMP or cGMP within neurons is believed to be related to the quality of memory, especially long term memory. Without wishing to be bound to any particular mechanism, it is proposed that, since PDE10 degrades cAMP or cGMP, the level of this enzyme affects memory in animals, for example, in humans. A compound that inhibits cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) can thereby increase intracellular levels of cAMP, which in turn activate a protein kinase that phosphorylates a transcription factor (cAMP response binding protein). The phosphorylated transcription factor then binds to a DNA promoter sequence to activate genes that are important in long term memory. The more active such genes are, the better is long-term memory. Thus, by inhibiting a phosphodiesterase, long term memory can be enhanced.	Dementias are diseases that include memory loss and additional intellectual impairment separate from memory. The compounds of the present invention are suitable for use in treating patients suffering from memory impairment in all forms of dementia. Dementias are classified according to their cause and include: neurodegenerative dementias (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Pick's disease), vascular (e.g., infarcts, hemorrhage, cardiac disorders), mixed vascular and Alzheimer's, bacterial meningitis, Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic (e.g., subdural hematoma or traumatic brain injury), infectious (e.g., HIV), genetic (down syndrome), toxic (e.g., heavy metals, alcohol, some medications), metabolic (e.g., vitamin B12 or folate deficiency), CNS hypoxia, Cushing's disease, psychiatric (e.g., depression and schizophrenia), and hydrocephalus.	The condition of memory impairment is manifested by impairment of the ability to learn new information and/or the inability to recall previously learned information. The present invention includes methods for dealing with memory loss separate from dementia, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and age-related cognitive decline. The present invention includes methods of treatment for memory impairment as a result of disease. Memory impairment is a primary symptom of dementia and can also be a symptom associated with such diseases as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Pick's disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, HIV, cardiovascular disease, and head trauma as well as age-related cognitive decline. The compounds of the present invention are suitable for use in the treatment of memory impairment due to, for example, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amylolaterosclerosis (ALS), multiple systems atrophy (MSA), schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Pick's disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, depression, aging, head trauma, stroke, spinal cord injury, CNS hypoxia, cerebral senility, diabetes associated cognitive impairment, memory deficits from early exposure of anesthetic agents, multiinfarct dementia and other neurological conditions including acute neuronal diseases, as well as HIV and cardiovascular diseases.	The compounds of the present invention are also suitable for use in the treatment of a class of disorders known as polyglutamine-repeat diseases. These diseases share a common pathogenic mutation. The expansion of a CAG repeat, which encodes the amino acid glutamine, within the genome leads to production of a mutant protein having an expanded polyglutamine region. For example, Huntington's disease has been linked to a mutation of the protein huntingtin. In individuals who do not have Huntington's disease, huntingtin has a polyglutamine region containing about 8 to 31 glutamine residues. For individuals who have Huntington's disease, huntingtin has a polyglutamine region with over 37 glutamine residues. Aside from Huntington's disease (HD), other known polyglutamine-repeat diseases and the associated proteins include dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, DRPLA (atrophin-1); spinocerebellar ataxia type-1 (ataxin-1); spinocerebellar ataxia type-2 (ataxin-2); spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (also called Machado-Joseph disease or MJD) (ataxin-3); spinocerebellar ataxia type-6 (alpha la-voltage dependent calcium channel); spinocerebellar ataxia type-7 (ataxin-7); and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, also know as Kennedy disease).	The basal ganglia are important for regulating the function of motor neurons; disorders of the basal ganglia result in movement disorders. Most prominent among the movement disorders related to basal ganglia function is Parkinson's disease (Obeso et al., Neurology. 62(1 Suppl 1):S17-30, 2004). Other movement disorders related to dysfunction of the basal ganglia include tardive dyskinesia, progressive supranuclear palsy and cerebral palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, Wilson disease, dystonia, tics, and chorea. The compounds of the invention are also suitable for use to treat movement disorders related to dysfunction of basal ganglia neurons.	PDE10 inhibitors are useful in raising cAMP or cGMP levels and prevent neurons from undergoing apoptosis. PDE10 inhibitors may be anti-inflammatory by raising cAMP in glial cells. The combination of anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as positive effects on synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, make these compounds useful to treat neurodegeneration resulting from any disease or injury, including stroke, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amylolaterosclerosis (ALS), and multiple systems atrophy (MSA).	Autoimmune diseases or infectious diseases that affect the basal ganglia may result in disorders of the basal ganglia including ADHD, OCD, tics, Tourette's disease, Sydenham chorea. In addition, any insult to the brain can potentially damage the basal ganglia including strokes, metabolic abnormalities, liver disease, multiple sclerosis, infections, tumors, drug overdoses or side effects, and head trauma. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be used to stop disease progression or restore damaged circuits in the brain by a combination of effects including increased synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, anti-inflammatory, nerve cell regeneration and decreased apoptosis.	The growth of some cancer cells is inhibited by cAMP and cGMP. Upon transformation, cells may become cancerous by expressing PDE10 and reducing the amount of cAMP or cGMP within cells. In these types of cancer cells, inhibition of PDE10 activity inhibits cell growth by raising cAMP. In some cases, PDE10 may be expressed in the transformed, cancerous cell but not in the parent cell line. In transformed renal carcinoma cells, PDE10 is expressed and PDE10 inhibitors reduce the growth rate of the cells in culture. Similarly, breast cancer cells are inhibited by administration of PDE10 inhibitors. Many other types of cancer cells may also be sensitive to growth arrest by inhibition of PDE10. Therefore, compounds disclosed in this invention can be used to stop the growth of cancer cells that express PDE10.	The compounds of the invention are also suitable for use in the treatment of diabetes and related disorders such as obesity, by focusing on regulation of the cAMP signaling system. By inhibiting PDE-10, especially PDE-1 OA, intracellular levels of cAMP are increased, thereby increasing the release of insulin-containing secretory granules and, therefore, increasing insulin secretion. See, for example, WO 2005/012485, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The compounds of Formula (I) can also be used to treat diseases disclosed in US Patent application publication No. 2006/019975, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.	Testing	The PDE10 inhibitory activities of the compounds of the prese nt invention can be tested, for example, using the in vitro and in vivo assays described in the Biological Examples below.	Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions	In general, the compounds of this invention can be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. The actual amount of a compound of this invention, i.e., the active ingredient, depends upon numerous factors, such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of administration, and other factors.	Therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of formula (I) may range from approximately 0.1-1000 mg per day; preferably 0.5 to 250 mg/day, more preferably 3.5 mg to 70 mg per day.	In general, compounds of this invention can be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by any one of the following routes: oral, systemic (e.g., transdermal, intranasal or by suppository), or parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous) administration. The preferred manner of administration is oral using a convenient daily dosage regimen, which can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction. Compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, or any other appropriate compositions.	The choice of formulation depends on various factors, such as the mode of drug administration (e.g., for oral administration, formulations in the form of tablets, pills or capsules are preferred) and the bioavailability of the drug substance. Recently, pharmaceutical formulations have been developed especially for drugs that show poor bioavailability based upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area, i.e., decreasing particle size. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,107,288 describes a pharmaceutical formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm in which the active material is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,684 describes the production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug substance is pulverized to nanoparticles (average particle size of 400 nm) in the presence of a surface modifier and then dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation that exhibits remarkably high bioavailability.	The compositions are comprised of, in general, a compound of formula (I) in combination with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients are non-toxic, aid administration, and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the compound of formula (I). Such excipient may be any solid, liquid, semi-solid or, in the case of an aerosol composition, gaseous excipient that is generally available to one of skill in the art.	Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk and the like. Liquid and semisolid excipients may be selected from glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol and various oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, etc. Preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions, include water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols.	Compressed gases may be used to disperse a compound of this invention in aerosol form. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.	Other suitable pharmaceutical excipients and their formulations are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gennaro, A. R. (Mack Publishing Company, 18th ed., 1995).	The level of the compound in a formulation can vary within the full range employed by those skilled in the art. Typically, the formulation contains, on a weight percent (wt %) basis, from about 0.01-99.99 wt % of a compound of Formula (I) based on the total formulation, with the balance being one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients. Preferably, the compound is present at a level of about 1-80 wt %.	The compounds can be administered as the sole active agent or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents such as other agents used in the treatment of psychoses, especially schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment and/or memory loss, e.g., nicotinic α-7 agonists, PDE4 inhibitors, other PDE10 inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, muscarinic m1 and m2 modulators, adenosine receptor modulators, ampakines, NMDA-R modulators, mGluR modulators, dopamine modulators, serotonin modulators, canabinoid modulators, and cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, rivastigimine, and galanthanamine). In such combinations, each active ingredient can be administered either in accordance with their usual dosage range or a dose below their usual dosage range, and can be administered either simultaneously or sequentially.

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES	Example 1	mPDE10A7 Enzyme Activity and Inhibition	Enzyme Activity. To analyze the enzyme activity, 5 μL of serial diluted mPDE10A7 containing lysate were incubated with equal volumes of diluted (100-fold) fluorescein labeled cAMP or cGMP for 30 min in MDC HE 96-well assay plates (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale Calif.) at room temperature. Both the enzyme and the substrates were diluted in the following assay buffer: Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) 50 mM, MgCl2 5 mM, 2-mercaptoethanol 4 mM, and BSA 0.33 mg/mL. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μL of diluted (400-fold) binding reagents and was incubated for an hour at room temperature. The plates were counted in an Analyst GT (Molecular Devices) for fluorescence polarization. An IMAP assay kit (Molecular Devices) was used to assess enzyme properties of mPDE10A7. Data were analyzed with SOFTMAX PRO software (Molecular Devices).	Enzyme Inhibition. To check the inhibition profile, 10 μL of serial diluted compounds were incubated with 30 μl of diluted PDE enzymes in a 96-well polystyrene assay plate for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, 5 μL of the compound-enzyme mixture were aliquoted into a MDC HE black plate, mixed with 5 μL of 100-fold diluted fluorescein labeled substrates (cAMP or cGMP), and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μL of diluted binding reagents and counted in an Analyst GT for fluorescence polarization. The data were analyzed with SoftMax Pro.	The IC50 values of a representative number of compounds of the invention in the above assay are as follows:	IC50	Cpd #	(nm)	1	1.1	5	2.3	6	2.6	8	12	11	258	14	143.3	15	0.2	22	1.7	24	0.8	25	12	26	9	Example 2	Apomorphine Induced Deficits in Prepulse Inhibition of the Startle Response in Rats, an in Vivo Test for Antipsychotic Activity	The thought disorders that are characteristic of schizophrenia may result from an inability to filter, or gate, sensorimotor information. The ability to gate sensorimotor information can be tested in many animals as well as in humans. A test that is commonly used is the reversal of apomorphine-induced deficits in the prepulse inhibition of the startle response. The startle response is a reflex to a sudden intense stimulus such as a burst of noise. In this example, rats are exposed to a sudden burst of noise, at a level of 120 db for 40 msec, e.g., the reflex activity of the rats is measured. The reflex of the rats to the burst of noise may be attenuated by preceding the startle stimulus with a stimulus of lower intensity, at 3 to 12 db above background (65 db), which attenuates the startle reflex by 20 to 80%.	The prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex, described above, may be attenuated by drugs that affect receptor signaling pathways in the CNS. One commonly used drug is the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine. Administration of apomorphine reduces the inhibition of the startle reflex produced by the prepulse. Antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol prevents apomorphine from reducing the prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex. This assay can be used to test the antipsychotic efficacy of PDE10 inhibitors, as they reduce the apomorphine-induced deficit in the prepulse inhibition of startle.	Example 3	Conditioned Avoidance Responding (CAR) in Rats, an in Vivo Test for Antipsychotic Activity	Conditioned avoidance responding (CAR) occurs, for instance, when an animal learns that a tone and light predict the onset of a mild foot shock. The subject learns that when the when the light and tone are on it must leave the chamber and enter a safe area. All known antipsychotic drugs reduce this avoidance response at doses which do not cause sedation. Examining the ability of test compounds to suppress the conditioned avoidance has been widely used for close to fifty years to screen for drugs with useful antipsychotic properties.	In this example, an animal is placed in a two-chambered shuttle box and presented with a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) consisting of a light and tone, followed by an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) consisting of a mild foot shock through a floor grid in the shuttle box chamber. The animal is free to escape the US by running from one chamber to the other, where the grid is not electrified. After several presentations of the CS-US pair, the animal typically learns to leave the chamber during the presentation of the CS and avoid the US altogether. Animals treated with clinically-relevant doses of antipsychotic drugs have a suppression of their rate of avoidances in the presence of the CS even though their escape response to the shock itself is unaffected.	
US20090062291_0010	Specifically, conditioned avoidance training is conducted using a shuttle box (Med Associates, St. Albans, Vt.). The shuttle box is divided into 2 equal compartments that each contain a light source, a speaker that emits an 85 dB tone when activated and an electrified grid that can deliver a scrambled foot shock. Sessions consist of 20 trials per day (intertrial interval of 25-40 sec) during which a 10 sec illumination and a concurrent 10 sec tone signals the subsequent delivery of a 0.5 mA shock applied for a maximum of 10 sec. Active avoidance, defined as the crossing into the opposite compartment during the 10 sec conditioning stimuli (light and tone) prevents the delivery of the shock. Crossing over to the other compartment after the delivery of the shock terminates shock delivery and is recorded as an escape response. If an animal does not leave the conditioning chamber during the delivery of the shock it is recorded as an escape failure. Training is continued daily until the avoidance of 16 or more shocks out of 20 trials (80% avoidance) on 2 consecutive days is achieved. After this criterion is reached the rats are given one day of pharmacological testing. On test day, rats are randomly assigned to experimental groups, weighed and injected intraperitoneally i.p. (1 cc tuberculin syringe, 26⅜ gauge needle) or p.o. (18 gauge feeding needle) with either control or compound solutions. Compounds are injected at 1.0 ml/kg for i.p. and 10 ml/kg for p.o. administration. Compounds can be administered either acutely or chronically. For testing, each rat is placed in the shuttle box, and given 20 trials with the same parameters as described above for training trials. The number of avoidances, escapes, and escape failures are recorded.	The foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example, for purposes of clarity and understanding.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION	The present invention relates to medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical science.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	Kinases are responsible for the control of a wide variety of signal transduction processes by phosphorylation of their target proteins. Kinases regulated processes include proliferation, growth, differentiation, metabolism, cell cycle events, apoptosis, motility, transcription, and translation. Kinases can function, either directly or indirectly, to activate, inactivate, or modulate the activity of the target protein. These target proteins may include, for example, metabolic enzymes, regulatory proteins, receptors, cytoskeletal proteins, ion channels or pumps, or transcription factors.	Polo-like kinases (PLKs including PLK1, PLK2, PLK3 and PLK4) are serine/threonine protein kinases that are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. In mammalian cells, PLK1 levels increase during mitosis. Target proteins for PLKs include cyclin B, a cohesin subunit of the mitotic spindle, subunits of the anaphase promoting complex, and mammalian kinesin-like protein 1 and other motor proteins. PLK1 has a role in the regulation of CDKs through phosphorylation and activation of Cdc25C leading to activation of CDK1 which is involved in cell division processes.	Modulation of kinases, such as PLK, is an especially attractive target for therapeutics. Certain inhibitors of PLK are disclosed in WO 2006/018185, WO 2007/095188, and WO 2008/076392. There is a continued need to find therapeutic agents to treat human diseases, including the treatment of multi-drug resistant cancers. The present invention provides inhibitors of PLKs.

Compounds of formula (1) are known in the art and are readily prepared from amides of the formula below:	which are themselves well known, for example, see US 2006/0176380 and WO 2008/076392. An appropriate compound of formula R9a—R8—NH—R7 is one in which R7 and R8 are as required in the final compound of formula I or give rise to R7 and R8 as desired and R9a ultimately gives rise to R9 in formula I and may be a protected R9. The use and selection of protecting groups is well known and appreciated in the art. See for example, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora Greene (Wiley-Interscience)).	While the reaction is discussed as using a compound of the formula R9a—R8—NH—R7 it is understood that the reaction can be carried out with other reagents, such as R12—R11—R10—R9—R8—NH—R7 as depicted in Scheme A, step a and discussed below. Other approaches are contemplated as well. For example, a group transferring what will give rise to R11—R10—R9—R8—NH—R7, either in one step or in two or more steps, followed by introduction of the group R12. A variety of other alternatives to introduce the groups group R12, R11, R10, R9, R8, and R7 are readily contemplated by the skilled person.	For example, a compound of formula (1) is reacted with an appropriate compound of formula R9a—R8—NH—R7. The reaction is carried out in a solvent, such as lower alcohol. The reaction is carried out with the use of a suitable acid, such as aqueous hydrochloric acid. The reaction typically is carried at temperatures of from about 80° C. to 100° C. The reaction typically requires 10 to 48 hours.	Alternately, for example, a compound of formula I is reacted with a compound of formula R9a—R8—NH—R7 without a solvent, or in a solvent such as, sulpholane, dimethylformamide, dimethyl acetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylsufloxide, dioxane, and the like. The reaction typically is carried at temperatures of from about 80° C. to 200° C. The reaction typically requires 1 to 48 hours.	In yet another variation a compound of formula I is reacted with a compound of the formula R9a—R8—NH—R7 using Buchwald conditions. For example, the reaction carried out in solvent, such as dioxane and dimethylacetamide. The reaction may be carried out using a palladium catalyst such palladium acetate, with our without a ligand, such as xanthophos. The reaction is carried out using an excess of a base such as cesium carbonate. The reaction may be facilitated by microwave irradiation. The reaction is typically carried out at temperatures of from about 120° C. to 200° C. and generally requires about 10 minutes to 2 hours.	In an optional step, not shown, a protected compound of formula (2) is deprotected.	Scheme A, step 2, depicts the reaction of a compound of formula (2) with a compound that introduces R12—R11—R10. Such reactions generally involve amide formations, sulfonation reactions, and alkylation reactions that are will understood in the art.	In an example of an amidation reaction a compound of formula (2) in which R9a is a carboxylic acid is reacted with a compound of the formula R12—R11—R10—NHR7 to give a compound of formula I in which R9 is —CONJ9-. Standard amide forming conditions are well known, including those using coupling agents, including those used in peptide couplings, such as 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate methanaminium (HATU), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride. Such reactions are generally carried out using a base, such as N-methylmorpholine or triethylamine, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, dimethylformamide (DMF), THF, and the like. If necessary or desired, an additive such as 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, and the like may be used to facilitate the reaction. Alternatively, other carboxylic acid equivalents, including acylating agents, such as an appropriate acylimidazole or a mixed anhydride or an appropriate acid halide may be reacted with the amine. It is readily understood that the same methodology can be used to prepare compound in which R9 is —NJ9CO— by starting with a compound of formula (2) in which R9a is an amine (having the group —NJ9) with a compound of the formula R12—R11—R10—CO2H.	In an analogous manner compounds of formula I in which R9 is —SO2NJ9- and —NJ9 SO2— can be formed by the reaction of sulfonyl halides with amines.	Alternately, a compound of formula I can be prepared directly as depicted in Scheme A, step a, by reacting a compound of formula I with a compound of formula R12—R11—R10—R9—R8—NH—R7. Such reactions are well known in the art. See WO 2006/021548. For example, the reaction carried out in solvent, such as dioxane and dimethylacetamide. The reaction may be carried out using a palladium catalyst such palladium acetate, with our without a ligand, such as xanthophos. The reaction is carried out using an excess of a base such as cesium carbonate. The reaction may be facilitated by microwave irradiation. The reaction is typically carried out at temperatures of from about 120° C. to 200° C. and generally requires about 10 minutes to 2 hours. The use of protecting groups may be beneficial in introducing such a group and if so can be readily employed by the skilled person.	In an additional optional step, not shown, a racemic mixture is resolved to give isomerically pure product. The specific pure stereoisomers and diasteromers of compounds of the invention can be prepared by a variety of methods known to the skilled person, such as resolution of mixtures and stereoselective synthesis by using stereochemically pure starting materials. The specific isomers of either starting materials or compounds of the invention can be obtained by techniques well known in the art, such as those found in Asymmetric Synthesis, edited by James P. Morrison (Academic Press 1983), Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, E. I. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley 1994) and Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions, J. Jacques, A. Collet, and S. H. Wilen (Wiley 1991), and those found in WO 97/25983 and WO 99/04778 such as chromatography, including on chiral stationary phases, enzymatic resolutions, or resolution of diastereomers formed for that purpose, including fractional crystallization of diastereomeric salts. As used herein the term “isomerically pure” refers to greater than 80%, preferably greater than 90%, more preferably greater than 95%, most preferably greater than 97% of a particular isomer.	It is also understood that the product of the present process may be used as a pharmaceutically acceptable salts which would be formed in an optional step, not shown. The formation of such salts is well known and readily practiced by the skilled person.	The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples and preparations. The terms and abbreviations used in the examples have their usual meaning unless otherwise indicated. Where indicated products of the preparations and examples were purified by chromatograph. Reverse phase chromatography was typically carried out on Waters Sunfire C-18, 5 μm, 30 mm×75 mm column or Phenomenex Gemini C-18 30 mm×75 mm AXIA column eluted with gradients of either 0.035% TFA in acetonitrile and 0.05% TFA in water or 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate in water and 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 20/80 water/acetonitrile. After isolation by reverse phase chromatography the product was typically obtained by evaporation of the solvent or evaporation of the solvent dilution with water adjusting the pH to basic, for example with saturated aqueous sodium carbonate, and extraction into an organic phase, followed by separation, drying, filtration, and evaporation. Normal phase chromatography was typically carried out using a NH-silica column eluted with gradients of ethyl acetate and hexanes. After isolation by normal phase chromatography the product was typically obtained by evaporation of the solvent. These examples and preparations are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the invention in any way.

The activity of compounds as PLK inhibitors may be determined by a variety of methods, including in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo methods. Example A is an in vitro enzymatic activity assay for activity against PLK1.	Example A	Purified PLK1 may be obtained as follows. cDNA encoding human PLK1 SEQ ID No. 1, Accession Number: NM—005030 was isolated by polymerase chain reaction PCR with primers SEQ ID Nos. 2 and 3 and cloned into pcDNA4/His-Max-TOPO Invitrogen, USA according to the manufacturer's manual. PCR was performed using the vector as a template. In the PCR, primers containing sequences encoding a FLAG-tag DYKDDDDK in the amino-terminal region SEQ ID No. 4 and vector sequence SEQ ID No. 5 were used. After XbaI and XhoI digestion of the PCR product, the fragment was subcloned into pFASTBAC1 Invitrogen, USA. Recombinant baculoviruses were prepared according to the procedure of the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system Invitrogen, USA. Sf21 cells were purchased from Invitrogen and grown in Sf-900 II SFM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 gentamicin and 0.1% pluronic F-68 Invitrogen, USA at 28° C. For preparation of PLK1 enzyme, Sf21 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses and cultured at 28° C. for 72 h. Cells were lysed and FLAG-tagged PLK1 protein SEQ ID No. 6 was purified by affinity chromatography using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel Sigma, USA.	It should be noted that a variety of other expression systems and hosts are also suitable for the expression of PLK1, as would be readily appreciated by one of skill in the art.	The inhibition of PLK1 by the compounds was determined with the following assay that measures the phosphorylation of alpha casein by recombinant PLK1. Kinase reactions were performed at room temperature for 40 min in the kinase reaction buffer 25 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmol/L magnesium acetate, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol containing 50 ng PLK1 enzyme, 0.1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 500 nmol/L ATP and 3 μg alpha casein MP Biomedicals Inc., USA in a final volume of 50 μL. The incubation was terminated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid Wako, Japan. Phosphorylated proteins were filtrated in GF/C filter plates Packard, USA with a Cell harvester Packard, USA and washed out free [γ-32P]-ATP with 250 mmol/L phosphoric acid. Then, the plates were air dried for 60 min at 45° C., followed by the addition of 20 μL of MicroScint-O Packard, USA. The radioactivity was counted by a Top-count scintillation counter Packard, USA. The IC50 values for test compounds were calculated by Prism 3.02 GraphPad Software, USA.	Examples B and C provides a method of determining in vivo activity.	Example B	The cell culture and proliferation assay may be carried out as follows: the HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line ATCC, USA was maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium Invitrogen, USA supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum JRH, USA. The cell proliferation assay was carried out with the Cell Titer-Glo luminescent cell viability assay Promega, USA according to the manufacture's instruction after the 72 hr treatment of the cells in the presence of the compounds. The cell viability was shown as a percentage of DMSO treated cells. The IC50 values for the compounds were calculated by Prism 4 GraphPad Software, USA.	Example C	For analysis of the cell cycle distribution and the phosphorylation of histone H3, the cells were harvested and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol after the 48 hr treatment of the cells in the presence of the compounds. The cells were washed twice with PBS containing 2% FCS JRH, then incubated with Alexa Flour 647-conjugated anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody Cell signaling, USA and RNase Invitrogen for 30 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS containing 2% FCS, the cells were counterstained with propidium iodide. The cell cycle distribution and phosphorylation of histone H3 were analyzed using the FACSCalibur system BD Bioscience, San Jose, Calif., USA.	The activity of compounds as PLK inhibitors can be further assessed in vivo using BALB/cA Jcl-nu/nu mice bearing the HCT116 or the HT29 cells inoculated subcutaneously in auxiliary area. The growth retardation may be determined, for example, by caliper measurements of the tumor volume.	pIC50 values are the negative of the log of the IC50s and may be calculated by non-linear curve fitting of the compound concentrations and fluorescence intensities to the standard pIC50 equation. The method of Example A gave pIC50 values greater than 7 for the examples above. Values for particular compounds from Example A are given in Table 1 below.

US4231938_0002	A. Endo et al., FEBS Letters, vol. 72, No. 2 (1976), pp. 323-326.	A. G. Brown et al., J.C.S. Perkin I (1976), pp. 1165-1169.	Nicholson; William H.	Westlake, Jr.; Harry E.	Substances isolated after cultivation of a microorganism belonging to the genus Aspergillus in a culture medium comprise a compound designated MSD803 which has the lactone structure: ##STR1## as well as its free hydroxy acid form. Together with salts and esters of the free acid form, these compounds form a class of highly active hypocholesteremic and hypolipemic medicaments.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	This invention relates to hypocholesteremic products from the cultivation of a microfungus of the genus Aspergillus. More specifically, it relates to a compound of the formula: ##STR2## and to the corresponding free hydroxyacid ##STR3## as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the latter and lower alkyl and substituted alkyl esters of the latter in which the possible substituent is phenyl, dimethylamino or acetylamino. The invention also relates to a process of cultivating the microfungus and isolating from the medium a hypocholesteremic compound of the above structures. These new compounds have excellent properties of inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and are useful against hypercholesteremia and hyperlipemia.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	Because of the possible connection between high blood cholesterol and atherosclerosis, many efforts have been made to find ways and substances which would reduce the cholesterol in the mammalian body. One of these ways is to inhibit in mammals the body's ability to synthesize cholesterol.	Recently, Endo et al., described (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,049,495 and 3,983,140) a fermentation product obtained by cultivation of a microorganism of the genus Penicillium and isolation from the medium. They called it ML 236 B and determined its structure together with two related compounds 236 A and 236 C. Its structure, under the name compactin, was also determined by A. G. Brown, T. C. Smale, T. J. King, J. Chem. Soc. (Perkin I) 1165 (1975). This compound has been found to be a strong inhibitor in vivo of the biosynthesis of cholesterol.	DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION	We have found that unexpectedly, the cultivation of a very different microorganism, a microfungus of the genus Aspergillus produces a new substance that is also a very potent inhibitor of the biosynthesis of cholesterol in mammals. We have further found that this substance comprises principally the new compound, MSD803, of the above structure, accompanied by only traces of other compounds, none of which appears to be those isolated by Endo et al. This new compound of our invention does not appear to be formed in the fermentations described by Endo. The new compound, MSD803, is a much more potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis in vivo than is the compound, ML236B described by Endo.	The compounds of this invention are highly useful as antihypercholesteremic agents for the treatment of atherosclerosis, hyperlipemia and like diseases in humans. They may be administered orally or parentally in the form of a capsule, a tablet, an injectable preparation and the like. It is usually desirable to use the oral route. Doses may be varied, depending on the age, severity, body weight and other conditions of human patients but daily dosage for adults is within a range of from about 2 mg. to 2000 mg. (preferably 10 to 100 mg.) given in three or four divided doses. Higher doses may be favorably applied as required.	The compounds of this invention also have useful antifungal activities. For example, they may be used to control strains of Penicillium sp., Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Cochliobolus miyabeorus and Hilminthosporium cynodnotis. For those utilities they are admixed with suitable formulating agents, powders, emulsifying agents or solvents such as aqueous ethanol and sprayed or dusted on the plants to be protected.	In another aspect of this invention, it relates to a process for producing the compounds of this invention which comprises cultivating a microorganism belonging to the genus Aspergillus and then recovering said compounds of this invention from the cultured broth. Based upon taxonomic studies, this Aspergillus, isolated and identified as a hitherto undescribed microorganism, has been designated MF-4833 in the culture collection of Merck and Co., Inc., Rahway, N.J. and a culture thereof has been placed on permanent deposit with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, and has been assigned accession No. ATCC No. 20541. Another sample, of a similar organism, designated MF-4845 in the Merck culture collection, has likewise been placed on deposit and has been given the accession number ATCC 20542. The latter organism is the one giving the better yield. Although the use of these is described in connection with the process of this invention, other organisms of the genus Aspergillus including mutants of the above ones are also capable of producing MSD803 and their use is contemplated in carrying out the process of this invention.	The morphological characteristics of the microorganisms MF-4833 and MF-4845 have been found to be those of the genus Aspergillus. Using the criteria specified in the standard authority "Manual of the Aspergilli", Charles Thom and Kenneth B. Rasper, published by the Williams and Wilkins Company, Baltimore, Md., 1945, and by comparison with know species, it has been determined that both strains are Aspergillus terreus.	The culture of these organisms to produce MSD803 is carried out in aqueous media such as those employed for the production of other fermentation products. Such media contain sources of carbon, nitrogen and inorganic salts assimilable by the microorganism.	In general, carbohydrates such as sugars, for example, glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, xylose, mannitol and the like and starches such as grains, for example, oats, ryes, cornstarch, corn meal and the like can be used either alone or in combination as sources of assimilable carbon in the nutrient medium. The exact quantity of the carbohydrate source of sources utilized in the medium depend in part upon the other ingredients of the medium but, in general, the amount of carbohydrate usually varies between about 1% and 6% by weight of the medium. These carbon sources can be used individually, or several such carbon sources may be combined in the medium. In general, many proteinaceous materials may be used as nitrogen sources in the fermentation process. Suitable nitrogen sources include for example, yeast hydrolysates, primary yeast, soybean meal, cottonseed flour, hydrolysates of casein, corn steep liquor, distiller's solubles or tomato paste and the like. The sources of nitrogen either alone or in combination, are used in amounts ranging from about 0.2% to 6% by weight of the aqueous medium.	Among the nutrient inorganic salts which can be incorporated in the culture media are the customary salts capable of yielding sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, phosphate, sulfate, chloride, carbonate, and like ions. Also included are trace metals such as cobalt, manganese, iron and magnesium.	It should be noted that the media described in the Examples are merely illustrative of the wide variety of media which may be employed, and yet are not intended to be limitative. Specifically, the carbon sources used in the culture media to produce MSD803 included dextrose, dextrin, oat flour, oatmeal, molasses, citrate, soybean oil, glycerol, malt extract, cod liver oil, starch, ethanol, figs, sodium ascorbate and lard oil. Included as nitrogen sources were peptonized milk, autolyzed yeast, yeast RNA, tomato paste, casein, primary yeast, peanut meal, distillers solubles, corn steep liquor, soybean mean, corn meal, NZ amine, beef extract, aspargine, cottonseed meal and ammonium sulfate. The major ionic components were CaCO3, KH2PO4, MgSO4.7H2O and NaCl and small amounts of CoCl2.6H2O and traces of Fe, Mn, Mo, B and Cu were also present.	The fermentation is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 20° to 37° C.; however, for optimum results it is preferable to conduct the fermentation at temperatures of from about 22° to 30° C. The pH of the nutrient media suitable for growing the Aspergillus culture and producing MSD803 can vary from about 6.0 to 8.0.	Although the novel compound is produced by both surfce and submerged culture, it is preferred to carry out the fermentation in the submerged state. A small scale fermentation is conveniently carried out by inoculating a suitable nutrient medium with the Aspergillus culture and, after transfer to a production medium, permitting the fermentation to proceed at a constand temperature of about 28° C. on a shaker for several days.	The fermenation is initiated in a sterilized flask of medium via one or more stages of seed development. The nutrient medium for the seed stage may be any suitable combination of carbon and nitrogen sources. The seed flask is shaken in a constant temperature chamber at about 28° C. for 2 days, or until growth is satisfactory, and some of the resulting growth is used to inoculate either a second stage seed or the production medium. Intermediate stage seed flasks, when used, are developed in essentially the same manner, that is, part of the contents of the flask from the last seed stage are used to inoculate the production medium. The inoculated flasks are shaken at a constant temperature for several days, and at the end of the incubation period the contents of the flasks are centrifuged or filtered.	For large scale work, it is preferable to conduct the fermentation in suitable tanks provided with an agitator and a means of aerating the fermentation medium. According to this method, the nutrient medium is made up in the tank and sterilized by heating at temperatures of up to about 120° C. Upon cooling, the sterilized medium is inoculated with a previously grown seed of the producing culture, and the fermentation is permitted to proceed for a period of time as, for example, from 3 to 5 days while agitating and/or aerating the nutrient medium and maintaining the temperature at about 28° C. This method of producing MSD803 is particularly suited for the preparation of large quantities.	The compound is conveniently isolated from the fermentation broth as the lactone. However, MSD803 is present in the fermentation broth largely as the hydroxycarboxylate (open lactone) form. It is possible to isolate this form and its salts. Alternatively, the lactone form can be hydrolyzed with bases such as NaOH to yield the corresponding salts such as the sodium salts. The use of bases with the pharmaceutically acceptable cations affords salts of these cations. Careful acidification of the salts affords the hydroxy acid form. Conversely, the hydroxy acid can be converted to the lactone form at acidic pH. Opening the lactone, under catalysis, with methanol, ethanol, propanol, or butanol or with phenyl, dimethylamino, or acetylamino alkanols yields the corresponding esters of this invention.	The physico-chemical properties of MSD803 in its lactone form are summarized as follows:	______________________________________	1.     Melting point  170°-171°	2.

Two unbaffled 2 liter Erlenmeyer flasks each containing 500 ml of medium B are then each inoculated with 10 ml per flask of the growth from the seed flask. Medium B has the following composition:	______________________________________	Medium B	______________________________________	Tomato paste           20 g	Primary yeast          10 g	CPC Starch             20 g	CoCl2 . 6H2O	5 mg	Distilled water        1000 ml	pH 7.2-7.4 with NaOH	______________________________________	These two inoculated flasks are incubated for 96 hours at 28°. One flask is incubated without agitation. The other flask is incubated on a 150 rpm shaker (2" throw). After 96 hours, the contents of each flask is set aside for isolation of the product.	B. Isolation	The whole broth is centrifuged for 20-30 min. Solids are saved for extraction. The supernatant liquid (pH 6-8) is charged to a 950 ml bottle and 150 ml XAD-2 resin is added. Using an automatic Extractor, operating on a preset schedule, the mixture is stirred for 2 hours. The spent broth is then siphoned off and discarded. The resin is washed twice with 200 ml of deionized water and the washes were discarded. There then is added a charge of 300 ml of mixed solvent: isopropanol-ethyl acetate-dichloromethane 25-45-30. The mixture is stirred two hours. The solvent-resin slurry is filtered on a Buchner or sintered glass funnel and the resin is discarded. The filtrate broth solids are stirred with 100 ml acetone for 1/2 hour. The mixture is then centrifuged and the supernatant liquor is decanted. The combined filtrates are concentrated to 15 ml.	C. Testing	The filtrates were tested as inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase enzyme by the method described by Beg, Stonik, Brewer and Bryan (1977 FEBS Letters 80 123 to 129) using enzymes prepared as described by Kleinsek, Rangatham and Porter (1977 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 74, 1431 to 1435). The positive test (over 90% inhibition at 20 micrograms per milliliter--an IC50 of 2.3 micrograms per milliliter indicated the presence of a very potent inhibitor of sterol synthesis acting at the HMG-CoA reductase level.	EXAMPLE 2	A. A tube of lyophilized culture of an Aspergillus sp. MF-4833 is opened aseptically and the contents suspended in an unbaffled 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask (seed flask No. 1) containing 40 ml of medium C. Medium C has the following compositions:	______________________________________	Medium C	______________________________________	Corn steep liquor     5 g	Tomato paste          40 g	Oatmeal               10 g	Glucose               10 g	
US4231938_0004	Trace element         10 g	Mix No. 2	Distilled water       1000 ml	pH 6.8 with NaOH	______________________________________	This inoculated flask is incubated for 24 hours at 28° C. on a 220 rpm shaker (2 inch throw) for 24 hours. Eight more unbaffled 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks (No. 2 seed flask) each containing 40 ml of medium C are then each inoculated with 2 ml per flask of the growth from seed flask No. 1. These eight No. 2 seed flasks are incubated for 24 hours at 28° C. on a 220 rpm shaker (2 inch throw). Twenty, two liter unbaffled Erlenmeyer flasks, containing 500 ml of medium B are then each inoculated with 14 ml per flask of the combined growth of the eight No. 2 seed flasks. These twenty flasks are incubated at 28°, with agitation for 11 days. After 11 days incubation, the contents of these twenty flasks are pooled.	B. 10.2 liters of whole broth, pH 6.0, was blended in a Waring blender to break up the heavy mycelial pads, centrifuged and the clear supernatant decanted. After filtration the 10 liters of filtrate was extracted with 3 liters of ethyl acetate, yielding 1820 ml of clear extract. A second extraction with 3 liters of ethyl acetate yielded 3350 ml of clear extract. The broth solids were extracted by stirring one hour with 2 liters of methanol and filtering to yield 2100 ml of filtrate.	Aliquots of these extracts were dried and sent for assay by the procedure of Example 1(C), with the following results:	______________________________________	Extract	Volume (ml)	Total Solids (mg)	Total Units of Activity	______________________________________	1820      1133          1,496,695	3350       787          314,900	2100      13.15         1,144,067	______________________________________	C. Gel Filtration	All of samples from the first two extracts in Example 2 (B) were combined, dissolved in methanol and filtered to remove insoluble solids. The 30 ml of filtrate was loaded onto a gel filtration column (2.5 cm×200 cm, 980 ml) packed with Sephadex LH-20 and the sample fractionated according to molecular size using methanol as solvent. With refractive index and U.V. recordings as guides, the best fractions were identified by bioassay.	______________________________________	Total Solids (mg)	Total Units of Activity	______________________________________	89tion 1       106,271	278tion 2       1,099,680	779tion 3       210,357	______________________________________	D. Separation and Purification	A sample from Fraction 2 above was prefiltered through a 1-gram bed of Waters Bondapak C18/Porasil B and eluted with five volumes of methanol. The methanol eluate was concentrated to 0.5 ml. This sample was chromatographed, over several runs, on a Waters μC18 column (3.9 mm×30 cm) with methanol: 0.05 M ammonium phosphate, pH 2.9 (75:25), as the developing solvent. Fractions were scanned on a Beckman Spectrophotometer, and those showing absorption maxima at 236 nm, with shoulders at 229 nm and 245 nm were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to an aqueous solution. The pH of the concentrate was adjusted to 6.5 with 2 M potassium hydroxide and the active components were extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried, and the residue dissolved in 0.3 ml methanol. The methanol solution was chromatographed as above and recycled. Cuts containing earlier eluting component were combined, concentrated to an aqueous solution and extracted with chloroform. The chloroform residue was taken up in methanol and the solvent evaporated under nitrogen. 3.5 mg. of dried product was obtained and identified as the open lactone form. Cuts containing the second component were combined and extracted with chloroform as above. 0.87 mg. of dried product was obtained and identified as the lactone.	Samples were sent for bioassay.

It is then stored at -60° C. for 3-4 months. A portion of the contents of this slant is then suspended in an unbaffled, 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask (No. 2 seed flask) containing 40 ml of medium C. The inoculated flask is incubated for 24 hours at 28° C. on a 220 rpm shaker (2 inch throw). Six unbaffled 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks (No. 3 seed flasks) containing 40 ml of medium C are then each inoculated with 2 ml per flask of the growth from the No. 2 seed flask. These six inoculated flasks are incubated for 48 hours at 28° C. on a 220 rpm shaker (2 inch throw).

After 11 days broth is delivered for extraction by the procedure of Example 2(B). Total production in these flasks is 1231 units/ml.	EXAMPLE 5	Best Mode of Fermentation with MF-4845	A tube of lyophilized culture of an Aspergillus, MF-4845, is opened aseptically and the contents suspended in an unbaffled 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask (seed flask) containing 40 ml of medium C. The inoculated flask is incubated for 30 hours at 28° on a 220 rpm shaker (2 inch throw). An unbaffled, 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 40 ml of medium G is inoculated with 2 ml per flask of the growth from the seed flask. Medium G has the following composition:	______________________________________	Medium G	______________________________________	Dextrose               45 g	Peptonized milk        24 g	Autolyzed yeast        2.5 g	Polyglycol P2000       2.5 ml	Distilled water        1000 ml	pH 7.0 with NaOH	______________________________________	This inoculated flask is incubated for 120 hours at 28° C. on a 220 rpm shaker (2 inch throw).

Large Scale Fermentation with MF4833	The medium used in each step of the fermentation comprised:	Corn steep liquor: 5 g	Tomato paste: 40 g	Oat Flour: 10 g	Glucose: 10 g	Trace element solution: 10 ml	Distilled water: 1000 ml	adjusted to pH 6.8 with sodium hydroxide.	The trace element solution comprised:	FeSO4.7H2O: 1 g	
US4231938_0006	MnSO4.4H2O: 1 g	CuCl2.2H2O: 25 mg	CaCl2 : 100 mg	H3BO4 : 56 mg	(NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O: 19 mg	Zn SO4.7H2O: 200 mg	distilled water: 1 liter	All mediums were checked for sterility before innoculation with a microorganism.	To a 250 ml non-baffled Erlenmeyer flask was charged 40 ml of medium and the contents of one tube of lyophillized organism MF 4833. It was then shaken for 24 hours at 28° C. on a rotary shaker at 220 rpm. New flasks were then charged with 40 ml of medium and 1 ml of the first flasks' contents and were shaken an additional 24 hours at 28° C. A 2 liter flask was then charged with 400 ml of medium and 10 ml of the second stage fermentation mixture and this too was shaken for 24 hours at 28° C.	A 200 gallon stainless steel fermentation vat was then charged with 501 liters of a medium comprising:	lactose: 2% wt/vol	distiller solubles: 1.5% wt/vol	autolyzed yeast: 0.5% wt/vol	Polyglycol P2000: 0.25% wt/vol	whose pH was adjusted to 7.0. This was sterilized 15 minutes at 121° C. One liter of the third stage above was then charged and the mixture was incubated at 130 rpm at 28° C. for 96 hours with an air flow of 10 cfm.	B. Isolation of MSD803	About 37.5 lbs. (3/4 bag) of a silicaceous filter aid was added to 110 gal. whole broth from the culture of MF-4833 described above and the mixture was filtered through an 18-inch filter press. The clarified filtrate, (pH 6.6) was adjusted to pH 4.0 by careful addition of 450 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and extracted by agitation with about one-third volume (36 gal.) of ethyl acetate. After separation, the upper solvent layer was removed, and the water phase again extracted with ethyl acetate (38 gal.) in a similar fashion. After separation, the two extracts were combined and back-washed by agitation with about twelve gallons of water. After separation, the ethyl acetate solution was concentrated under vacuum at a temperature below 30° C., first in a stirred kettle, and finally in a rotary vacuum evaporator to a residual volume of slightly less than one gallon.	Approximately 1 gal. (3800 ml) of ethyl acetate concentrate from the preceding extraction was further concentrated in a rotary evaporator (ca 10 mm, 40° C. bath) to a syrup and was then concentrated twice more, after addition of about one liter of methylene chloride in two portions, to free the syrup of polar solvent. The final oil of about 300 ml which contained about 250 g of solids by dry weight determination, was made up to about 750 ml with ethyl acetate methylene chloride (30/70; v/v) and 200 g of silica gel was added and mixed in to form a slurry. This was layered over the top of a 14 cm by 36 cm column bed holding 2.5 kg of the same silica gel, in about 7.5 l volume, which had been packed as a slurry in the same solvent mixture. Development with the same solvent was continued until 3 liters of effluent was taken off as forerun.	Development with ethyl acetate-methylene chloride (50/50; v/v) was begun, taking 800 ml effluent fractions. Twelve fractions were taken, then 100% ethyl acetate elution was begun, and after seven more fractions, 100% acetone elution was begun. Fractions four through twenty-four were assayed for bio-activity in the HMG-CoA Reductase inhibition assay referred to in Example 1. Substantial activity was found in fractions 7 through 11. Peak activity was found in fraction 8. It was concentrated to an oil for further purification; dry wt. by solids determination was 9.0 gm.	Fraction 8 from the silica gel column was triturated with 50 ml methylene chloride and filtered; the dried filter cake weighed 4.9 gm. The filtrate was charged to a 2-inch I.D. by 1-meter long column filled with Sephadex LH-20 dextran gel (Pharmacia) swollen and equilibrated in methylene chloride, and the column was eluted with methylene chloride at a rate of 15 ml/min. MSD803 is eluted between 0.64 and 0.81 column volumes. Solvent was removed from this peak leaving a slightly brown residue weighing approximately 0.290 gm. 213 mg. of this residue was taken up in 1.5 ml of CH2Cl2 --CH3CN (65-35), charged to a prepacked and equilibrated silica gel column (EM LOBAR Size B) and eluted with CH2Cl2 --CH3CN (65-35) at 5 ml/min. Evaporation of solvent from the peak eluting between 235 and 360 ml of eluant left 121 mg of crystalline product, m.p.  155°-160° C. HPLC of this material on a EM RP 18 reverse-phase analytical column (E Merck HIBAR II, Cat. No. 906046) using 0.05 M sodium phosphate pH 3.0-acetonitrile 45-55 as eluant at 2 ml/min. showed a characteristic uv absorbing peak at 11 min.	Eighty-two mg of this material was recrystallized from 0.6 ml of absolute ethanol, then again from 0.4 ml of the same solvent to afford, after drying over-night in a desiccator over P2O5, 40 mg of white feathery crystals. Analytical HPLC on the system described above gave a single sharp peak at 11 minutes elution time. After further recrystallizations, a melting point of 170°-171° C. was obtained.	The product was identified by spectra, etc., as the lactone form of MSD803. This material, in the in vitro HMG-CoA reductase test (of Example 1) gave an lC50 of 0.01 micrograms per milliliter.	EXAMPLE 7	Salts of MSD803	To a solution of 40 mg the product of Example 6 in 2 ml of ethanol is added 1 ml of aqueous NaOH (10-4 moles; 1 equivalent). After one hour at room temperature, the mixture is taken to dryness in vacuo to yield the sodium salt of the free acid form of MSD803.	In like manner the potassium salt is prepared using one equivalent of potassium hydroxide and the calcium salt using one-half equivalent of CaO. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts are likewise prepared using equivalent quantities of the appropriate base.	EXAMPLE 8	Preparation of Free Hydroxy Acid of MSD803	The sodium salt produced in Example 7 is redissolved in 2 ml of ethanol-water (1:1) and added to 10 ml of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid from which the liberated hydroxy acid is extracted with ethyl acetate. The latter solvent is washed once with water, dried and removed in vacuo with a bath temperature not exceeding 30°. The hydroxy acid derived slowly reverts to the lactone on standing.	EXAMPLE 9	To a solution of 4 mg of the product of Example 6 in 1 ml of absolute ethanol is added 0.1 ml 0.1 M sodium ethoxide in absolute ethanol. This solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for one hour, is then diluted into water and extracted twice with water, the ethyl acetate dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate is removed in vacuo to yield the ethyl ester of MSD803.

US4254129_0004	Reduction of the various compounds illustrated in Schemes I and II using, for example, sodium borohydride or potassium borohydride is carried out in lower alcohol solvents, such as, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol or n-butanol. When lithium aluminum hydride or diborane are used as reducing agents as illustrated in Schemes I and II suitable solvents are ethers, for example, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane. These reduction reactions are carried out at temperatures ranging from about 0° C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent, and the reaction time varies from about 0.5 to 8 hours.	Catalytic reduction may also be employed in the preparation of compounds of the invention as shown in Schemes I and II above, using, for example, Raney nickel, palladium, platinum or rhodium catalysts in lower alcohol solvents, such as, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol or n-butanol or acetic acid or their aqueous mixtures, or by the use of aluminum isopropoxide in isopropyl alcohol. Reduction using sodium borohydride is preferred over catalytic reduction in preparing, for example, compounds, (VIII) or (X). When in compounds (1), (4) and (8), R6 and R7 form a double bond, catalytic reduction is less preferred. In preparing the alcohols represented by compounds (XI) lithium aluminum hydride is the preferred reducing agent when the starting material employed is either compounds (4) or (VIII) and diborane is preferred when the starting material is compounds (X) or (8). Base hydrolysis of compounds (VIII) to give compounds (X) is achieved by procedures well known in the art, for example, by treatment with an inorganic base, such as, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in an aqueous lower alcoholic solvent, such as, aqueous methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol or n-butanol at reflux temperatures for about 1/2 hour to 12 hours.	The compounds of Formula I wherein B is hydroxy and R3 is --CH3 or --COOH are prepared by treating a compound of the following Formula XII with a slight excess of thallium trifluoroacetate in trifluoroacetic acid at reflux temperature (about 72° C.) for about three hours after which 1 equivalent of lead tetraacetate in trifluoroacetic acid is added. The mixture is stirred for about 1/2 hour then 1 equivalent of triphenylphosphine is added. Stirring is continued for about 1/2 hour followed by removal of excess solvent at reduced pressure then the addition of cold and dilute (6 N) hydrochloric acid. The lead chloride and thallium chloride are filtered off, and the filtrate is made alkaline with 10% sodium hydroxide solution and a minimum amount of ethanol is added to bring about complete solution. The solution is refluxed for about 4 hours, neutralized, then concentrated, extracted with toluene, dried, filtered and concentrated to give the appropriate compound of Formula I wherein R3 is methyl or --COOH and B is hydroxy. The compounds of Formula I wherein R3 is --COOalkyl and B is hydroxy are obtained by treating 1 equivalent of the corresponding derivative wherein R3 is --COOH with 2 or 3 equivalents of boron trifluoride etherate and about 20 or 30 equivalents of an alcohol of the formula R8OH wherein R8 is a straight or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The mixture is refluxed for about 24 hours, according to the general procedure of Kadaba, J. Pharm. Sci. 63, 1333 (1974). Upon cooling the mixture is added to about 100 ml of water, concentrated at reduced pressure on a water bath, and the product purified by crystallization from alcohols or mixtures thereof with toluene. ##STR6## In the above Formula XII, R9 is hydrogen or trifluoroacetyloxy; R10 is hydrogen; or R9 and R10 taken together form a second bond between the carbon atoms bearing R9 and R10 ; p is an integer of from 1 to 5; and R11 is methyl or --COOalkyl wherein the alkyl moiety has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and is straight or branched.	The compounds of Formula XII wherein R11 is methyl and each of R9 and R10 is hydrogen or R9 and R10 taken together form a second bond between the carbon atoms bearing R9 and R10 are known in the art or may be prepared by procedures well known in the art. The compounds of Formula XII wherein each of R9 and R10 is hydrogen or R9 and R10 taken together form a second bond between the carbon atoms bearing R9 and R10 and R11 is --COOalkyl are prepared as described herein. See compounds VIII in Scheme II. The compounds of Formula XII wherein R9 is trifluoroacetyloxy are prepared by treating a ketone of the Formula ##STR7## wherein R12 is methyl or --COOalkyl, and q is an integer of from 1 to 5; with trifluoroacetic anhydride for about 2 to 6 hours at temperatures of about 0° to 25° C. with stirring followed by catalytic reduction using, for example, platinum oxide in methanol and 1 atmosphere hydrogen in a Paar apparatus to take up an equivalent amount of hydrogen.	The ketone compounds used herein as starting materials, i.e., in Scheme I compounds (I), in Scheme II compounds (4) and (8) and the compounds of Formula XIII are prepared by alkylation of a substituted piperidine derivative of the formula ##STR8## with an ω-haloalkyl substituted phenyl ketone of the formula ##STR9## wherein R13 is hydrogen or hydroxy; R14 is hydrogen; or R13 and R14 taken together form a second bond between the carbon atoms bearing R13 and R14 ; halo is a halogen atom, such as, chlorine, bromine or iodine; W is hydrogen or β-methoxyethoxymethyl-O (memoxy); z is an integer of from 1 to 5; R15 is methyl or --COOalkyl wherein the alkyl moiety has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and is straight or branched; with the provisos that when A is hydroxy, W is memoxy, and when R15 is methyl, W is memoxy. When R15 is --COOH the alkylation reaction is followed by base hydrolysis. When A is hydroxy in the ketone compounds (1), (4) or (8) the alkylation reaction is followed by cleavage of the memoxy group. The alkylation reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent preferably in the presence of a base and optionally in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium iodide for about 4 to 120 hours and at temperatures of about 70° C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent. Suitable solvents for the alkylation reaction include alcohol solvents, such as, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, or n-butanol; ketone solvents, such as, methyl isobutyl ketone; hydrocarbon solvents, such as, benzene, toluene or xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons, such as, chlorobenzene or methylene chloride or dimethylformamide. Suitable bases for the alkylation reaction include inorganic bases, for example, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, or potassium bicarbonate or organic bases, such as, a trialkylamine, for example, triethylamine or pyridine, or an excess of a compound of Formula XIV may be used. Cleavage of the β-methoxyethoxymethyl (MEM) group to give compounds (1), (4) or (8) wherein A is hydroxy is achieved by using trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature or using 5 to 8equivalents of powdered anhydrous zinc bromide in methylene chloride at about 25° C. by the general procedure of E. J. Corey et al., Tetrahedron Letters No. 11, pp. 809-812 (1976). Base hydrolysis of the compounds wherein R15 is --COOalkyl to give the corresponding compounds wherein R15 is --COOH is achieved by treatment with an inorganic base, such as, sodium hydroxide in an aqueous lower alcohol solvent, such as, aqueous methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol or n-butanol at reflux temperature for about 1/2 hour to 12 hours. When in compounds (8) A is hydroxy, removal of the MEM group using trifluoroacetic acid prior to base hydrolysis of the ester group is preferred.	The compounds of Formula XIV wherein each of R13 and R14 is hydrogen and wherein R13 is hydroxy and R14 is hydrogen are commercially available. The compounds of Formula XIV wherein R13 and R14 form a second bond between the carbon atoms beaing R13 and R14 may be prepared by dehydration of the corresponding compound wherein R13 is hydroxy by procedures generally known in the art.	The compounds of general Formula XV wherein W is memoxy are prepared by treating a phenol of the following Formula XVI ##STR10## with an ω-halo alkanoic acid of the formula halo(CH2)z -COOH wherein halo is for example, chlorine or bromine and z is an integer of from 1 to 5 in the presence of boron trifluoride by the generally described procedure of Delschager and Mousa, Arch. Pharm. 306, 807 (1973). The phenol and acid are melted together at about 50° C. then cooled to about 10° C. after which boron trifluoride is added in an amount about 2.2 times the molar amount of phenol employed. The mixture is heated at about 70° C. for about 2 hours after which a 30% sodium acetate solution is added and extracted with ether. The organic layer is dried and the residue crystallized to give a hydroxy ketone of the formula ##STR11## wherein halo is, for example, chlorine or bromine, Z is 1 to 5 and R15 is --CH3 or --COOalkyl. The hydroxy ketone is then treated with a triethylammonium reagent of the formula CH3OCH2CH2OCH2NEt3+Cl- in acetonitrile according to the general procedure of E. J. Corey et al., Tetrahedron Letters No. 11, pp. 809-812 (1976).	The compounds of Formula XV wherein W is hydrogen are prepared by reacting an appropriate straight or branched lower alkyl C1-6 ester of α,α-dimethylphenylacetic acid, which are known in the art or are prepared by procedures well known in the art, with a compound of Formula XVII, wherein halo and Z have the meanings defined above, under the general conditions of a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The reaction is carried out in a solvent such as, carbon disulfide, tetrachloroethane or nitrobenzene with carbon disulfide being a preferred solvent. The reaction time varies from about 1/2 hour to 8 hours, preferably 3 to 5 hours and the reaction temperature varies from about 0° to 25° C. ##STR12##	The compounds of Formula XVII are commercially available or may be prepared by methods well known in the art. The compound of Formula XVI wherein R15 is methyl is also commercially available (Aldrich). The compounds of Formula XVI wherein R15 is --COOalkyl are prepared by treating a hot solution of an appropriate straight or branched alkyl C1-6 ester of 3-trifluoroacetoxyphenylacetic acid in dimethoxyethane with a base, such as, sodium hydride under a nitrogen atmosphere followed by the addition of methyliodide in dimethoxyethane to the mixture over about a 20 minute period. The mixture is refluxed for about 3 hours then concentrated to remove most of the solvent after which diethyl ether, then water are added cautiously. The organic layer is separated, extracted with ether, dried over magnesium sulfate and distilled to give the appropriate ester of α,α-dimethyl-3-trifluoroacetoxyphenylacetic acid. To a solution of the methylated ester in 50% alcohol/water is added 3X molar amount of potassium carbonate. The solution is stirred at about 25° C. for about 8 hours then concentrated to a semisolid at reduced pressure at about 50° C., and upon cooling water is added and the mixture is neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid then extracted with ether. The ether extract is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to give the appropriate ester of 3-hydroxy-α,α-dimethylphenylacetic acid. The esters of trifluoroacetoxyphenylacetic acid are known in the art or may be prepared by procedures generally known in the art, for example, from m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. For example, the hydroxyl group is protected by, e.g., treatment with trifluoroacetic anhydride, then the protected phenol acid may be treated with, e.g., an excess of an appropriate lower alcohol in the presence of a small amount of mineral acid, e.g., sulfuric acid at reflux.

The mixture is stirred and heated at boiling for about 3 hours after which 30 ml of tetrahydrofuran is added. The mixture is refluxed for 4 hours and let stand overnight (about 16 hours). Stirring the mixture under a nitrogen atmosphere, 2 ml of water is added cautiously followed by 2 ml of 10% sodium hydroxide, 2 ml of water and 4 g of sodium sulfate. The mixture is warmed to 50°-55° C. and stirred for 45 minutes, filtered and the solid material is washed with tetrahydrofuran. The combined filtrates are evaporated in vacuo, and the residue is recrystallized from ethanol to give α,α-dipenyl-1-[4-[4-hydroxy-tert-butyl)phenyl]-4-hydroxybutyl]-4-piperidinemethanol, M.P. 134°-136° C.

The mixture is refluxed for 31/2 hours and concentrated to a solid after which a minimum amount of methanol to dissolve the residue is added. 10% Aqueous HCl is added until pH 7 is reached, the methanol removed by evaporation and water (25 ml) is added. The resulting precipitate is recrystallized from methanol-butanone to give 4-[4-[4-(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-1-piperidinyl]-1-hydroxybutyl]-α,α-dimethylbenzeneacetic acid, M.P. 195°-197° C.

The hexapeptide amides of Formulas I-VIII are useful as Substance P agonists and/or antagonists and are therefore useful as analgesics and/or as antihypertensives.	In a process aspect the invention is the process of preparing a hexapeptide amide of Formulas I-VIII which comprises condensing the corresponding amino acid and/or peptide moieties by a 1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2 or 5+1 hexapeptide forming method, concomitantly protecting and deprotecting the N-terminal α-amino group, the C-terminal carboxyl group and any side chain amino or carboxyl group as required.	In all of the hexapeptide amides of Formulas I-VIII the N-terminal amino acid moiety is L-prolyl or D-prolyl. The amino acid moieties are considered as being numbered successively by the integers from 1 through 6 beginning on the left with L-prolyl or D-prolyl and ending on the right with the amino acid moiety bearing the terminal primary amide group. Thus, a 1+5 peptide condensation in accordance with the process aspect of the invention is a condensation of amino acid moiety 1 with pentapeptide moiety 2-6 with protection and deprotection as required. Similarly, a 2+4 peptide condensation is a condensation of dipeptide moiety 1-2 with tetrapeptide moiety 3-6; a 3+3 peptide condensation is a condensation of tripeptide moiety 1-3 with tripeptide moiety 4-6; a 4+2 peptide condensation is a condensation of tetrapeptide moiety 1-4 with dipeptide moiety 5-6; and a 5+1 peptide condensation is a condensation of pentapeptide moiety 1-5 with amino acid moiety 6.

The suitably carboxyl-activated derivatives of the amino acid and peptide intermediates can be formed and used with or without being isolated and include the acyl halides and pseudohalides, especially the acyl azides; the anhydrides, especially the mixed anhydrides and most especially the mixed anhydride with diphenylphosphinyl chloride or isobutyl chloroformate; derivatives formed by addition reactions, especially using dicyclohexylcarbodimide; displaceable acyl derivatives of heterocyclic nitrogen; ring-openable activated heterocyclic systems; acylphosphonium derivatives; activated esters, especially 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), N-hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) and pentafluorophenyl (PFP) esters; and polymeric (solid phase) derivatives.	It is necessary that the N-terminal α-amino group be protected during the peptide forming steps. The preferred α-amino protecting groups are benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), which can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation using palladium as catalyst or by hydrogen bromide in acetic acid, and t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), which can be removed by acidic cleavage, for example, with hydrogen chloride in a suitable solvent or trifluoroacetic acid with or without a solvent. A protecting group which can be removed in the presence of benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl under basic conditions, for example piperidine in dimethylformamide, is 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). Amino groups in the side chains of basic amino acids can be protected by benzyloxycarbonyl, t-butoxycarbonyl or p-toluenesulfonyl (Tos), the last of which can be removed with liquid hydrogen fluoride containing anisole as a cation scavenger.	The C-terminal carboxyl group must also be protected during the peptide forming steps. That of the compounds of Formulas I-VIII is protected as the amide, which is a required structural feature thereof and is therefore not removed. The C-terminal carboxyl groups and any side chain carboxyl group of the intermediate amino acids and peptides can be protected as the carboxylate salt, the t-butyl (tBu) ester, which can be removed by acidic cleavage, for example, with hydrogen chloride in a suitable solvent or trifluoroacetic acid, or the benzyl (Bz) ester, which can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation using palladium as catalyst.	The intermediate amino acids and peptides and other synthetic intermediates necessary to prepare the compounds of Formulas I-VIII are known classes of compounds and are commercially available or can be made by methods specifically or generally described in the chemical literature.	The acid addition salts of the compounds of Formulas I-VIII are prepared by conventional methods from any of the pharmaceutically acceptable organic and inorganic acids. Of the inorganic acids hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid are particularly preferred. Of the organic acids acetic acid is particularly preferred.	The compounds of Formulas I-VIII and the acid addition salts thereof are hydrophilic and may form solvates with water or hydrophilic organic solvents or mixtures thereof. If the resulting products are crystalline, they are purified by recrystallization. If they are non-crystalline, which is generally so, they are purified by high pressure liquid chromatography or column chromatography and/or isolated by lyophylization.	In the preparations described below structures of products are inferred from known structures of starting materials and expected courses of preparative reactions. Structural confirmation and estimation of purity of starting materials and products are measured by melting temperature range (m.r.), optical rotation ([α]D25), elemental analysis, infrared (IR) spectral analysis, ultraviolet (UV) spectral analysis, mass spectral (MS) analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral analysis, gas chromatography (GLC), column chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC) and/or amino acid analysis.

BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE COMPOUNDS	As stated above the hexapeptide amides of Formulas I-VIII are useful as Substance P agonists and/or antagonists and are therefore useful as analgesics and/or as antihypertensives. These utilities are shown by a test for tritiated substance P (3H-SP) binding in rat submaxillary gland tissue or rat brain tissue, a test for SP agonist and antagonist effect in the guinea pig ileum, a test for SP antagonist effect in the rat vas deferens, and a test for protection against acetylcholine-induced writhing in the mouse.	Rat Submaxillary Gland or Brain Tissue 3H-SP Binding Test	Crude rat submaxillary gland or brain tissue is suspended in buffer containing protease inhibitors (and calcium ions and magnesium ions in the case of brain tissue) and incubated under nitrogen atmosphere with 3H-SP and test compound. The bound SP is then separated from free SP by filtration and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. This test meets the criteria of reversibility, saturability, sensitivity to known SP agonists and antagonists, and specificity for an SP receptor binding assay.	With regard to reversibility, addition of unlabelled SP causes a gradual decrease in bound 3H-SP, showing that SP is not irreversibly bound to the receptors in the tissue. With regard to saturability, the amount of bound 3H-SP in the preparation increases in direct proportion to the concentration of 3H-SP added until a saturation point is reached. A Scatchard analysis of these data suggests that a single receptor is involved and that 3H-SP has a high affinity for this receptor. With regard to sensitivity, known SP agonists and antagonists inhibit 3H-SP binding. With regard to specificity, known substances structurally unrelated to SP including capsaicin and baclofen do not affect 3H-SP binding.	The results are expressed either as percent inhibition at a concentration of 30 micromoles per liter (μM) or as an IC50 calculated as the concentration in micromoles per liter. The compounds tested and found to be inhibitors in the submaxillary gland tissue preparation and then tested in the brain tissue preparation were found to have approximately the same degree of inhibition in both preparations.	Guinea Pig Ileum Test	Strips of longitudinal muscle derived from terminal ileum of adult male guinea pigs (Charles River, 400-600 g.) are mounted in 5-ml. organ baths containing oxygenated Krebs solution containing 1 μM each of atropine and pyrilamine maintained at 30-33 C. and connected to isometric transducers. Following tissue equilibration and repeated washing (45-60 min.), SP or an appropriate reference agonist is added cumulatively to the bath and contractions of the tissue are recorded. The bath is washed thoroughly and 30-45 min. is allowed to elapse before construction of a second reference agonist curve to assure reproducibility of the responses. Test compounds are similarly evaluated for agonist activity up to a maximum concentration of 10-100 μM. Regression analysis of the linear portion of the log concentration-percent maximal response curves provides the EC50 (and 95% confidence limits), the standard measure of agonist potency. When appropriate, relative molar potency ratios are calculated (EC50 reference/ED50 test drug). Antagonist activity is examined by pretreating thoroughly washed tissues with test compound (using a standard 5-10 min. contact time), then constructing a cumulative dose-response curve to the reference agonist. The effects of several concentrations of test antagonist, pooled across separate experiments, provide dose-ratio (EC50 shift) data for a standard Schild plot analysis, with computation of the pA2.	Rat Vas Deferens Test	Rat vasa deferentia are suspended in organ baths containing warmed, oxygenated Krebs solution and repetitively field-stimulated (0.1 Hz., 1 msec. duration, monophasic pulses) through platinum wire ring electrodes. Rapid, regular contractions of the muscle are recorded via transducers on a Grass polygraph. SP and related tachykinins added to the bath evoke a dose-dependent, stable potentiation of these electrically-induced contractions. For routine screening, a 10 μM concentration of SP is applied to all tissues to produce a 2-6 fold increase in electrically-stimulated twitch height.

A test compound in a vehicle or the vehicle alone is administered intrathecally in a volume of 5 μl by the method of Hylden and Wilcox (European Journal of Pharmacology, vol. 67, pp. 313-316, 1980) except that caudal cutaneous incision is not performed prior to injection. Five minutes after the injection a solution of acetylcholine (3.2 mg./kg., the approximate ED90) in 0.9% aqueous sodium chloride is administered intraperitoneally to each mouse. A mouse not exhibiting one or more writhes during the next two-minute observation period is considered protected by the test compound. For test compounds which produce a graded dose-response ED50 values with 95% confidence limits are determined by probit analysis of the data.	In this test the hexapeptide amide of Example 17 was administered in doses of 0.1-30 μg/mouse in a 5% aqueous dextrose vehicle. ED50 values of 2.4 (1.2-7.4) and 4.1 (2.5-6.8) μg/mouse were obtained.	The compounds of Formulas I-VIII can be prepared for use as Substance P agonists and/or antagonists and as analgesics and/or antihypertensives for oral or parenteral administration in liquid or solid dosage form as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, capsules or tablets with conventional pharmaceutical vehicles and adjuncts by conventional pharmaceutical techniques.

This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 463,081, filed Feb. 2, 1983, abandoned.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	This invention relates to certain dihydropyridines, specifically to certain 1,4-dihydropyridines having a substituted-amino containing group attached to the 2-position, which have utility as anti-ischaemic and antihypertensive agents.	The compounds of the invention reduce the movement of calcium into the cell and they are thus able to delay or prevent the cardiac contracture which is believed to be caused by an accumulation of intracellular calcium under ischaemic conditions. Excessive calcium influx during ischaemia can have a number of additional adverse effects which would further compromise the ischaemic myocardium. These include less efficient use of oxygen for ATP production, activation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and possibly, promotion of cell necrosis. Thus the compounds are useful in the treatment or prevention of a variety of cardiac conditions, such as angina pectoris, cardiac arrythmias, heart attacks and cardiac hypertrophy. The compounds also have vasodilator activity since they can inhibit calcium influx in cells of vascular tissue and they are thus also useful as antihypertensive agents and for the treatment of coronary vasospasm.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	According to the invention, there are provided novel 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives of the formula: ##STR2## wherein Y is --(CH2)2 --, --(CH2)3 --, --CH2CH(CH3)-- or --CH2C(CH3)2 --;	R is aryl or heteroaryl;	R1 and R2 are each independently C1 -C4 alkyl or 2-methoxyethyl; and	R3 is hydrogen, C1 -C4 alkyl, 2-(C1 -C4 alkoxy)ethyl, cyclopropylmethyl, benzyl, or --(CH2)mCOR4 where m is 1, 2 or 3 and R4 is hydroxy, C1 -C4 alkoxy or --NR5R6 where R5 and R6 are each independently hydrogen or C1 -C4 alkyl;	and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION	The compounds of the formula (I) containing one or more asymmetric centres will exist as one or more pairs of enantiomers, and such pairs or individual isomers may be separable by physical methods, e.g. by fractional crystallisation of the free bases or suitable salts or chromatography of the free bases. The invention includes the separated pairs as well as mixtures thereof, as racemic mixtures or as separated d- and l- optically-active isomeric forms.	The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the formula (I) are those formed from acids which form non-toxic acid addition salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, maleate, fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate and gluconate salts. The preferred salts are maleates.	The term "aryl" as used in this specification, includes, for example, phenyl optionally substituted by one or two substituents selected from nitro, halo, C1 -C4 alkyl, C1 -C4 alkoxy, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl, and cyano. It also includes 1- and 2-naphthyl.	The term "heteroaryl" as used in this specification includes, for example, benzofuranyl; benzothienyl; pyridyl optionally monosubstituted by methyl or cyano; quinolyl; benzoxazolyl; benzthiazolyl; furyl; pyrimidinyl; thiazolyl; 2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl; 2,1,3-benzthiadiazol-4-yl; and thienyl optionally monosubstituted by halo or C1 -C4 alkyl.	"Halo" means fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo.	C3 and C4 alkyl and alkoxy groups can be straight or branched chain.	R3 is preferably H, CH3, benzyl, 2-methoxyethyl, --CH2COOCH3, --CH2COOC2H5, --CH2CONH2, --CH2CONHCH3, or --CH2COOH.	R3 is most preferably H or CH3.	R is preferably 2-chlorophenyl, 2-fluorophenyl, 2-methoxyphenyl, 3-chlorophenyl, 2-chloro-3-hydroxyphenyl, 2-chloro-6-fluorophenyl, unsubstituted phenyl or 2,3-dichlorophenyl.	R1 is preferably CH3.	R2 is preferably C2H5.	Y is preferably --(CH2)2 -- or --CH2CH(CH3)--.	"m" is preferably 1.	Most preferably, R is 2-chlorophenyl.	Most preferably, Y is --(CH2)2.	The most preferred compounds have the formula (I) wherein R is 2-chlorophenyl, R1 is CH3, R2 is C2H5, R3 is H or CH3, and Y is --(CH2)2 --.	The compounds of the formula (I) are primary or secondary amines and in one method they can be prepared by the removal of the amino-protecting group from the corresponding amino-protected dihydropyridines.	This general method can be illustrated in more detail as follows: ##STR3## (Q=an amino-protecting group and R, R1, R2, R3 and Y are as defined for formula [I]); ##STR4## [R, R1, R2 and Y are as defined for formula (I)].	One preferred amino-protecting group is benzyl. It is typically removed by hydrogenation, using e.g. H2 /Pd on charcoal under acidic conditions in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. methanol. The acidic conditions are preferably obtained by using compound (II) in the form of an organic acid addition salt, e.g. as an oxalate or acetate salt.	A typical procedure involving the removal of a benzyl group is as follows. Compound (II) as an oxalate salt in methanol is added to a suspension of 10% pre-hydrogenated palladium on charcoal in methanol, and the mixture is then stirred under hydrogen at 50 p.s.i. for up to about 18 hours, e.g. overnight, and at room temperature. If necessary, heating at up to about 60° C. can be provided. The product can then be isolated and purified by conventional procedures.	When both Q and R3 are benzyl, hydrogenation under the above conditions normally only removes one of the benzyl groups. Further hydrogenation of the resulting monobenzyl product under the above conditions with fresh catalyst can then be used to remove the remaining benzyl group.	Many of the starting materials of the formula (II) in which Q is benzyl are described and claimed in our European patent application publication No. 0060674. Typical methods to the N-benzyl starting materials of the formula (II) are as follows:	(a) The benzyl-protected intermediates (II) can be prepared by the Hantzsch synthesis, as follows: ##STR5##	
US4572909_0003	In a typical procedure, the ketoester (IV) and aldehyde are heated under reflux in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. a C1 -C4 alkanol solvent such as ethanol, for about 15 minutes, and then the aminocrotonate (III) is added. Alternatively the aminocrotonate (III), ketoester (IV) and aldehyde can be heated together in the solvent. Preferably a small amount of a lower alkanoic acid such as acetic acid is added to neutralise the solution. The resulting solution can then be heated at 60°-130° C., preferably under reflux, until the reaction is essentially complete, typically in 24 hours or less. The product of the formula (II) can then be isolated and purified by conventional procedures.	The ketoesters (IV) are either known compounds or can be prepared by methods analogous to those of the prior art, such as the method illustrated in the Preparations hereinafter, which are essentially the method of Troostwijk and Kellogg, J.C.S. Chem. Comm., 1977, page 932. Similarly the amino-crotonates (III) are either known compounds or can be prepared by conventional procedures. Also the aldehydes are either known or can be prepared by known methods.	(b) The benzyl-containing intermediates (II) can also be prepared by the following process: ##STR6##	The crotonate (VI) is typically prepared in situ by reaction of the corresponding acetoacetate (IV): ##STR7## with ammonium acetate, e.g. by refluxing in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. a C1 -C4 alkanol such as ethanol, for, say, up to an hour. The crotonate (VI) is then reacted with compound (V), typically by heating in the solvent for up to about 5 hours at 60° C.-130° C., e.g. under reflux. The product (II) can then be isolated and purified by conventional procedures.	The starting materials (V) are either known compounds or may be prepared by methods analogous to those of the prior art, see e.g. Can. J. Chem., 1967, 45, 1001.	The compounds of the formula (I) in which R3 is H can be prepared from the corresponding phthalimido derivatives according to conventional procedures, e.g.: ##STR8##	The prefered primary amine is methylamine. The preferred alkali metal hydroxide is potassium hydroxide.	The reaction using methylamine is typically carried out in ethanol at room temperature, with heating if necessary. The reaction using hydrazine hydrate is typically carried out in ethanol at the reflux temperature or below. The reaction using potassium hydroxide is typically carried out at room temperature (although with heating if necessary) in tetrahydrofuran, following by the addition of the acid and heating at the reflux temperature or below. In all cases the product can be isolated conventionally.	The phthalimido starting materials can again be obtained conventionally, e.g.: ##STR9##	This is again the Hantzsch reaction.	Compounds of the formula (I) in which R3 is H can also be purified to very high levels by reacting them with phthalic anhydride to form the phthalimido derivatives which can then be converted back to the compounds in which R3 is H by the methods previously described.	To prepare compounds in which R3 is C1 -C4 alkyl, --COOCH2CCl3 can be used as the amino-protecting group. This can be removed in a conventional manner using zinc and either formic or acetic acid. The N-protected starting materials necessary for this process can be prepared as follows: ##STR10##	Typically the reaction with 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chloroformate is carried by heating the reactants at up to reflux temperature in e.g. toluene. Many of the dialkylamino and N-alkyl-N-benzylamino starting materials needed to prepared these N-protected intermediates are described and claimed in our corresponding European patent application publication No. 0060674, and others can be prepared analogously.	The compounds of the formula (I) where R3 =H can also be obtained from the corresponding azido compounds, the azido group being convertable to --NH2 by reduction, e.g. with triphenylphosphine, or zinc and hydrochloric acid, or H2 /Pd, under conventional conditions. ##STR11##	In a typical procedure using zinc dust, the reaction is carried out in methanol/aqueous hydrochloric acid. Heating is possible but is not generally necessary. Similarly hydrogenation can be carried out in e.g. methanol or ethanol in the presence of a catalyst such as Pd/CaCO3 at room temperature.	Again the azido starting materials can be prepared by the Hantzsch synthesis under conditions similar to those previously described: ##STR12##	The azido-containing acetoacetates can also be obtained by conventional procedures: ##STR13##	Similarly the azido starting materials can also be prepared analogously to route (b) above for preparing the N-benzyl starting materials.	Some of the compounds of the invention can be prepared from other compounds of the invention by conventional techniques, e.g.: ##STR14##	The ability of the compounds to inhibit the movement of calcium into the cell is shown by their effectiveness in reducing the response of isolated heart tissue to an increase in calcium ion concentration in vitro. The test is performed by mounting spirally cut strips of rat aorta with one end fixed and the other attached to a force transducer. The tissue is immersed in a bath of physiological saline solution containing potassium ions at a concentration of 45 millimolar and no calcium. Calcium chloride is added to the bath with a pipette to give a final calcium ion concentration of 2 millimolar. The change in tension caused by the resulting contraction of the tissue is noted. The bath is drained and replaced with fresh saline solution and, after 45 minutes, the test is repeated with the particular compound under test present in the saline solution. The concentration of compound required to reduce the response by 50% is recorded.	The antihypertensive activity of the compounds is also evaluated after oral administration by measuring the fall in blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats or renally hypertensive dogs.	For administration to man in the curative or prophylactic treatment of cardiac conditions and hypertension, oral dosages of the compounds will be in the range of from 2-50 mg daily for an average adult patient (70 kg). Thus for a typical adult patient, individual tablets or capsules are likely to contain from 1 to 10 mg of active compound, in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or carrier. Dosages for intravenous administration would be within the range 1 to 10 mg per single dose as required.	In a further aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.	The invention also provides a compound of the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, for use in treating ischaemic heart disease, especially angina, or hypertension, in a human being.	The following Examples illustrate the invention: all temperatures are in °C.:	EXAMPLE 1	Preparation of 4-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-[2-(methylamino)ethoxymethyl]-3-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyridine, oxalate salt ##STR15##	A solution of 2-[2-(N-benzyl-N-methylamino)ethoxymethyl]-4-[2-chlorophenyl]-3-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyridine, oxalate salt (4.3 g) in methanol (220 ml) was added to a suspension of 10% (by weight) palladium on charcoal (0.4 g) pre-hydrogenated in methanol (50 ml). Stirring under hydrogen at 50 p.s.i. and room temperature overnight resulted in complete removal of the benzyl group. After removal of the catalyst by filtration, the methanol was removed by evaporation and the residue crystallised from a little methanol to give the title compound (2.4 g), m.p. 211°.

After stirring a further 10 minutes the solution was decanted from excess zinc, the methanol evaporated and the aqueous acid residue washed with toluene (100 ml), basified with concentrated ammonia and extracted with methylene chloride (2×100 ml). The extracts were dried (Na2CO3), filtered and evaporated to dryness. The residue in toluene was chromatographed on a medium pressure column of silica (T.L.C. grade, Merck "Kieselgel" [Trade Mark] 60H, 7 g) eluting initially with toluene, changing gradually to methylene chloride and then to methylene chloride plus 3% methanol. Appropriate fractions were combined and converted to the maleate salt in ethyl acetate. Recrystallisation from acetone and ethyl acetate (1:1) gave the title compound (maleate salt) (190 mg, 1% yield from 2-azido ethanol) as a white solid, m.p. 169°, identical by t.l.c. with the product obtained in Example 9.

After cooling to room temperature, the resulting solid was collected, washed twice with methanol and dried to give the title compound (28 g). The product could be crystallised from methanol, acetone or ethyl acetate. It was used directly.	PREPARATION 10	Preparation of ethyl 4-(2-azidoprop-1-oxy)acetoacetate ##STR57##	A mixture of 2-bromopropan-1-ol (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 7681, 96, [1974]) (19.75 g) and sodium azide (10.0 g) was heated on a steam-bath for four days, allowed to cool to room temperature, and then washed four times with ether. The combined ether washings were filtered and evaporated to give 2-azidopropan-1-ol (12.3 g) as a pale brown oil which was shown by g.l.c. to be 98% pure.	A solution of the 2-azidopropan-1-ol (10.1 g) in tetrahydrofuran (100 ml) was added over two minutes to a stirred, ice-cooled suspension of sodium hydride (6.6 g; 80% dispersion in oil) in tetrahydrofuran (50 ml). The mixture was stirred for 15 minutes with ice-cooling and then treated over 20 minutes with a solution of ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate (16.4 g) in tetrahydrofuran (150 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours and evaporated. The residue was diluted with water, washed twice with ether, acidified with 2M hydrochloric acid, and extracted three times into ether. The combined ether extracts were dried (Na2SO4) and evaporated to give crude ethyl 4-(2-azidoprop-1-oxy)acetoacetate (20 g), used directly.	PREPARATION 11	Preparation of 2-chloro-3-trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde	2-Chloro-1-trifluoromethylbenzene (54.15 g) was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (500 ml) and stirred while cooling to -68° under a stream of dry nitrogen. (The whole reaction is carried out under dry nitrogen until the addition of distilled water.) To this was added n-butyl lithium (180 ml of a 1.6M solution in hexane) dropwise keeping the temperature below -60°. After stirring at -68° for a further 2 hours, a solution of dimethylformamide (22 ml) in dry tetrahydrofuran (100 ml) was added dropwise keeping the temperature below -60°. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature slowly over 17 hours and distilled water (200 ml) was then added. The organic phase was separated off and the aqueous liquors were extracted with ether (100 ml). The combined ether extracts plus the organic phase were washed with saturated brine, dried (MgSO4), filtered and evaporated to give 61.5 g of an orange oil, being the crude title compound.	This oil was then added to an aqueous sodium bisulphite solution (65 g in 600 ml distilled water) and heated at 60° for 0.5 hours. The solution was extracted with methylene chloride (3×100 ml) and, after acidification of the aqueous phase with concentrated sulphuric acid to pH1, was heated at 100° for a further 0.5 hours. The resultant aqueous solution was extracted with methylene chloride (3×200 ml) and the combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4), filtered and evaporated to give 42 g of a colourless solid which was crystallised from hexane to give the title compound, m.p. 43°-44°.

The present invention relates to the novel compound of the following formula: ##STR1## as well as acid addition salts thereof, a method for the preparation of the compound of Formula I, and to the use of said novel compound in the preparation of the known antidepressant drug 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	The preparation and properties of antidepressant substituted 1-dimethylaminopropyl-1-phenylphthalans (or 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-phenyl-1,3-dihydroisobenzofurans) have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,136,193. The most interesting of these compounds contain a cyano-group, and one of these, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile, has shown great promise as a valuable antidepressant drug with few side effects.	It has been found, however, that the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,136,193 for the preparation of this compound possess some problems in the scale-up to commercial production, and this has necessitated further research in an attempt to discover a shorter route to this compound and to avoid the risk involved in the metalation step used previously.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	It is an established fact that the cyano-group of aromatic nitriles is very sensitive to attack by a number of organic as well as inorganic compounds (see for example "Methoden der Organischen Chemie", Houben-Weyl, Vol. 8, 345-51, 429, Georg-Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart (1952)).	For example, nitriles may be attacked by Grignard reagents to give ketimines which can be hydrolyzed to ketones. This method is a recommended standard method for preparation of ketones ("Methoden der Organischen Chemie", Houben-Weyl, Vol. 13/2a, 353-366, Georg-Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart (1973)). Actually, advantage of this invention has already been taken (as mentioned in U.S. Pat. No. 4,136,193) with molecules closely related to those of the present invention.	It is also wellknown that treatment of nitriles with strong acids such as high-percentage sulfuric acid normally will hydrolyze the nitrile-group to a carboxylic acid amide or a carboxylic acid.	The most useful method of preparation described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,136,193 involves Grignard reactions as well as treatment with strong acid, but the nitrile group was always introduced subsequent to such steps because of the known reactivity of the nitrile group described above. Typically, the cyano-group was introduced by reaction of a halogen substituted phthalane (as for example 1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-5-bromophthalane) with cuprous cyanide in DMF to yield a cyano-phthalane (as for example 1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-5-phthalanecarbonitrile) which was metalated and then alkylated through reaction with 3-dimethylaminopropyl chloride to yield the desired 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-phenylphthalan, especially 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-5-phthalancarbonitrile.	According to the method of the present invention it has now surprisingly been found that cyano-substituted compounds can be prepared in good yields by the following route: ##STR2##	The compound of Formula II is the wellknown antidepressant drug 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile.	The 5-cyanophthalide (Formula III) used as a starting material is a known compound (Tirouflet, J.; Bull.Soc.Sci.Bretagne 26, 35, (1951).	
US4650884_0002	In the formulas IV, V and VI "hal" means halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine. It is, indeed, surprising that only modest amounts of biproducts are formed by reaction of the cyano-group with the two Grignard-reagents involved. Of similar great importance to the success of this scheme is the surprisingly low rate of ring opening of the addition product formed in the first Grignard step (Formula IV). Actually, it is very convenient from a practical point of view to be able to run these two Grignard reactions in succession in the same vessel.	The novel intermediate (of Formula I) produced in the combined Grignard steps may be isolated and purified as described below. However, it is far more convenient to proceed with the ring closure of the crude material.	The cyano-group also shows a surprising resistance to the rather drastic and prolonged treatment with strong acid in the step of ring closure.	With careful control of the reaction conditions involved this process has already been shown to be very reliable on a technical scale as evidenced by smooth performance, stable yields and high purity of the final product (Formula II) produced.	The following examples are given by way of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting;	EXAMPLE 1	4-[4-(Dimethylamino)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1-hydroxybutyl]-3-(hydroxymethyl)-benzonitrile	A Grignard solution is prepared by addition of 1-bromo-4-fluorobenzene (594 g, 3.4 mole) in dry tetrahydrofuran (1.6 liters) to a suspension of magnesium turnings (101 g, 4.15 mole) in dry tetrahydrofuran (250 ml) at reflux. When all has been added the solution is left stirring for 30 minutes without cooling or heating, and is then filtered to remove excess magnesium turnings. The Grignard solution is added to a nitrogen purged slurry of 5-cyanophthalide (450 g, 2.83 mole) in dry tetrahydrofuran (2.9 liters) in the course of 3 hours. The temperature is kept at 0°-3° C. during the addition after which the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min. without cooling and then left standing overnight.	The same day a second Grignard solution is prepared from 3-dimethylaminopropyl chloride (342 g, 2.81 mol) and magnesium turnings (81 g, 3.3 mol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (1.15 liters). Next day the filtered solution of 3-dimethylaminopropylmagnesium chloride is added in the course of 6 hours to the reaction mixture obtained in the first Grignard reaction. The temperature is kept at 10°-12° C. during the addition whereupon the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes without cooling, and is then left overnight at room temperature without stirring. The reaction mixture is poured into icewater (2 kg ice, 3 liters water) whereupon acetic acid (700 ml, 80% by weight) is added, resulting in a final pH of 6.5-7.0 in the solution. Tetrahydrofuran is then distilled until a maximum pot temperature of 50° C. at 60 mm Hg is reached, whereupon toluene (4.5 liters) is added to the mixture. Aqueous ammonia (300 ml, 25% by weight) is then added to give a final pH of 9 in the water layer, the temperature is adjusted to 45°-50° C., and the mixture is stirred for 15 minutes. The toluene layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted once with toluene (600 ml). The combined toluene extracts are washed with warm (50° C.) water (600 ml) and are then extracted with dilute acetic acid (2.5 liters water and 800 ml acetic acid, 80% by weight). The acetic extract is separated and combined with toluene (3.8 liters), whereupon aqueous ammonia (900 ml, 25% by weight) is added to give a final pH of 9 or higher in the water layer. The toluene phase is separated, and the water layer is extracted once with toluene (600 ml), whereupon the combined toluene extracts are washed four times with warm (50° C.) water (4×1 liter). This toluene solution is normally used directly in the next step.	If desired, the title compound can be isolated and purified in the following manner:	The warm toluene solution from above is stirred for 30 min. at 60° C. with charcoal (50 g) and silica gel (150 g, Merck Darmstadt No. 7734) and then filtered by suction on a filter pretreated with filter aid. This treatment is repeated with charcoal (25 g) and silica gel (90 g). After filtration the toluene is removed at reduced pressure (20 mm Hg) to a maximum of 60° C. The resulting oil (640 g) is dissolved in boiling diethyl ether (1500 ml) and this solution is stirred vigorously with water (1500 ml) while adding 47% aqueous hydrogen bromide (190 ml) during 10 min. at 27°-34° C. Diethyl ether is then distilled at reduced pressure at 33°-35° C. Additional water (500 ml) is added, and the mixture is cooled to 11° C. After 18 hours the crystals are collected on a suction filter. The wet cake is recrystallized from water (1500 ml) with the use of charcoal (37 g) and then dried for 23 hours in a vacuum oven at 50° C. and 220 mm Hg. Yield: 525 g of solid material which is purified further from a hot mixture of 2-propanol (9.5 liters) and ethanol (2.73 liters) with the use of charcoal (82 g) and silica gel (191 g) after which the filtrate is mixed with hexane (2 liters) and then cooled to 12° C. The crystals are isolated by suction and then dried in vacuum (200 mm Hg) at room temperature.

EXAMPLE 2	1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide	The toluene solution containing the crude product mentioned in Example 1 is heated to 50° C., and 70% sulfuric acid (made from 321 g of 96% sulfuric acid and 119 g ice) is added while stirring. The mixture is heated to 80° C. and kept at this temperature for 3 hours, whereupon it is cooled to about 30° C. Cold water (600 ml) and aqueous ammonia (600 ml, 25% by weight) are then added, and the mixture (pH 10) is stirred at 50°-60° C. for 15 minutes. The water phase is discarded, and the toluene layer is washed 5 times with warm water (5×1 liter). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and stirred for 1 hour with silica gel (375 g). The mixture is filtered by gravity on a filter precharged with silica gel (188 g). The filter is rinsed with toluene (3.4 liters) and the combined filtrates are evaporated under reduced pressure (30 mm Hg) until a maximum temperature of 50° C. is reached. The residue is then dissolved in acetone (2 liters) and filtered with charcoal. The filtrate is cooled to 20° C. Gaseous hydrogen bromide (130-140 g) is then introduced during 2 hours at 20°-25° C. until pH is 3, and pH is then adjusted to 7 by adding some of the acetone solution of the title compound. The mixture is left crystallizing overnight whereupon the crystals are filtered and washed with hexane (750 ml) and then with acetone (750 ml). After drying at 45° C. a yield of 610-650 g crude title compound is obtained. This material is dissolved in water (1.8 liters) at about 55° C. and is then filtered with charcoal, cooled to 20° C. and left overnight for crystallization after addition of seed crystals. The crystals are filtered, washed with water (350 ml) and dried. Yield: 560-570 g.	The crystals from the 1st recrystallization are dissolved in a mixture of methanol (1.7 liters) and 2-propanol (3.4 liters) at 70° C., and are then filtered with charcoal, cooled to 20° C. and left for crystallization overnight. The crystals are filtered and washed with a mixture of methanol (150 ml) and 2-propanol (300 ml). After drying there is obtained 510-520 g of purified material.	The material from the 2nd recrystallization is dissolved in a mixture of methanol (510 ml) and acetone (2.04 liters) at 55° C. and is then filtered with charcoal. The filtrate is cooled to 20° C., and after addition of seed crystals hexane (4.1 liters) is slowly added during 1 hour. After crystallization overnight the crystals are filtered and washed first with a mixture of acetone (150 ml) and hexane (300 ml), and then washed two times with hexane (2×300 ml). After drying there is obtained 470-480 g of pure (1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile, hydrobromide, MP 185°-186° C.	I claim:	1.

Pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds, and a method of inhibiting the biosynthesis of cholesterol employing such pharmaceutical compositions are also disclosed.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	The present invention is related to compounds and pharmaceutical compositions useful as hypocholesterolemic and hypolipidemic agents. More particularly, this invention concerns certain trans-6-[2-(3- or 4-carboxamidosubstitutedpyrrol-1-yl)alkyl]-4-hydroxypyran-2-ones and the corresponding ring-opened acids derived therefrom which are potent inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase), pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds, and a method of inhibiting the biosynthesis of cholesterol employing such pharmaceutical compositions.	High levels of blood cholesterol and blood lipids are conditions involved in the onset of arteriosclerosis. It is well known that inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase are effective in lowering the level of blood plasma cholesterol, especially low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), in man (cf. M. S. Brown and J. L. Goldstein, New England Journal of Medicine, 305, No. 9, 515-517 (1981). It has now been established that lowering LDL-C levels affords protection from coronary heart disease (cf. Journal of the American Medical Association, 251, No. 3, 351-374 (1984).	Moreover, it is known that certain derivatives of mevalonic acid (3,5-dihydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid) and the corresponding ring-closed lactone form, mevalonolactone, inhibit the biosynthesis of cholesterol (cf. F. M. Singer et al., Proc. Soc. Exper. Biol. Med., 102: 370 (1959) and F. H. Hulcher, Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 146: 422 (1971)).	U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,983,140; 4,049,495 and 4,137,322 disclose the fermentative production of a natural product, now called compactin, having an inhibitory effect on cholesterol biosynthesis. Compactin has been shown to have a complex structure which includes a mevalonolactone moiety (Brown et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I (1976) 1165.	U.S. Pat. No. 4,255,444 to Oka et al. discloses several synthetic derivatives of mevalonolactone having antilipidemic activity.	U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,198,425 and 4,262,013 to Mitsue et al. disclose aralkyl derivatives of mevalonolactone which are useful in the treatment of hyperlipidemia.

In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis in a patient in need of such treatment by administering an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition as defined above.	DETAILED DESCRIPTION	The compounds of the present invention comprise a class of trans-6-[2-(3- or 4-carboxamidosubstituted pyrrol-1-yl)alkyl]-4-hydroxypyran-2-ones in which the pyran-2-one moiety is attached, through an alkyl chain, to the substituted pyrrole nucleus at the nitrogen, or 1-position, of the pyrrole. The alkyl group may be methylene, ethylene, propylene, or methylethylene. The preferred alkyl chain linking the substituted pyrrole nucleus and the 4-hydroxypyran-2-one ring is ethylene.	The compounds of structural formula I above possess two asymmetric carbon centers, one at the 4-hydroxy position of the pyran-2-one ring, and the other at the 6-position of the pyran-2-one ring where the alkylpyrrole group is attached. This asymmetry gives rise to four possible isomers, two of which are the R-cis- and S-cis-isomers and the other two of which are the R-trans- and S-trans-isomers. This invention contemplates only the trans- form of the compounds of formula I above.	In the compounds of the present invention, position 2 of the substituted pyrrole nucleus is substituted with 1-naphthyl; 2-naphthyl; cyclohexyl; norbornenyl; 2-, 3-, or 4-pyridinyl; phenyl, phenyl substituted with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, hydroxyl; trifluoromethyl; alkyl of from one to four carbon atoms, alkoxy of from one to four carbon atoms, or alkanoyloxy of from two to eight carbon atoms. Preferred substituent groups at the 2-position of the pyrrole nucleus are phenyl and substituted phenyl.	In the compounds of this invention, position 5 of the pyrrole nucleus is substituted with alkyl of from one to six carbon atoms; cyclopropyl; cyclobutyl; cyclopentyl; cyclohexyl; or trifluoromethyl. Preferred substituents are alkyl or trifluoromethyl with isopropyl being particularly preferred.	The preferred reaction sequence which is used to prepare compounds of the present invention involves the cycloaddition of a disubstituted acetylene, in which one substituent is carboxamido or N-substituted carboxamido, to an appropriately substituted N-acylaminocarboxylic acid to form a substituted pyrrole. This addition may occur in either of two ways, leading to a substituted pyrrole addition product in which the carboxamido substituent resides on either carbon 3 or 4 of the pyrrole nucleus.	Thus, in compounds of the present invention, the substituent at either position 3 or 4 of the pyrrole nucleus is --CONR5R6 where R5 and R6 are independently hydrogen; alkyl of from one to six carbon atoms; 2-, 3-, or 4-pyridinyl; phenyl; phenyl substituted with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, cyano, trifluoromethyl, or carboalkoxy of from three to eight carbon atoms and the other of the two positions is unsubstituted or is substituted with alkyl of from one to six carbon atoms; cyclopropyl; cyclobutyl; cyclopentyl; cyclohexyl; phenyl; or phenyl substituted with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, hydroxyl; trifluoromethyl; alkyl of from one to four carbon atoms, alkoxy of from one to four carbon atoms, or alkanoyloxy of from two to eight carbon atoms.	Preferred groups for R5 and R6 are hydrogen, phenyl, or substituted phenyl. In a particularly preferred group of compounds within the present invention, R5 is hydrogen and R6 is phenyl or substituted phenyl.	The compounds of this invention are prepared by the general reaction scheme outlined in Reaction Sequence 1 which takes advantage of the chemistry of mesionic compounds of the type described originally by R. Huisgen et al., Ang. Chem. Int. Ed., 3: 136 (1964).	The known, or readily prepared, α-haloesters of structural formula II are reacted with the known 2-[1-(2-aminoalkyl)]-1,3-dioxalane, III, in the presence of an acid scavenger such as triethylamine to produce the N-alkyl-α-aminoesters, IV. The aminoesters, IV are ##STR5## acylated with an acid halide and subsequently hydrolyzed in aqueous base solution to produce the N-acyl-N-alkyl aminoacids, V.	The N-acyl-N-alkyl aminoacids, V, are reacted with the appropriately substituted carboxamido acetylenic compounds, VI, in the presence of an acid anhydride to produce a mixture of the isomeric substituted pyrrole compounds VIIa and VIIb. Depending upon the substituents present, this cyclo-addition reaction affords differing ratios of the two products. For example, in the situation where R4 is trifluoromethyl, the reaction yields roughly equimolar amounts of the two isomeric products. In such situations, the two isomeric products are separated by chromatographic techniques well known in the art, and subsequently further purified, if desired, by recrystallization. On the other hand, in the case where R4 is 1-methylethyl, the cyclo-addition reaction yields predominantly one product which can be purified by recrystallization alone.	
US4681893_0003	Hydrolysis of the acetal function of compounds VIIa and VIIb in aqueous acid solution affords the aldehydes VIIIa and VIIIb. The aldehydes, VIII, are further converted to compounds of the present invention by the processes depicted in Reaction Sequence 2.	The aldehyde compounds, VIII, are reacted with the dilithium or lithio-sodio salt of methyl acetoacetate to produce the corresponding 7-(substituted-pyrrolyl)-5-hydroxy-3-oxoheptanoates, IX. The heptanoates, IX, are dissolved in a polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, through which a small amount of air has been bubbled. A slight excess of a trialkylborane, such as tributylborane, is added to the mixture which is then cooled to a temperature of preferably between about 0° C. and -78° C. after which sodium borohydride is added.	The mixture is stirred for about one to two hours and then oxidized by the addition of basic aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution. The reaction produces the 7-(substituted-pyrrolyl)-3,5-dihydroxyheptanoic acids, ##STR6## X, in which the product contains a predominance of the desired R*,R* configuration at carbon atoms three and five which bear the hydroxy groups.	The acids may be converted to a corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salt by conventional means, if desired, or cyclized to the trans-6-[2-(substituted-pyrrol-1-yl)alkyl]pyran-2-ones, I, by dehydration in an inert solvent such as refluxing toluene with azeotropic removal of water. This cyclization step has been found to produce material containing from 85-90% of the desired trans-configuration of the 4-hydroxy group relative to the 6-(substituted-pyrrol-1-yl)alkyl group on the pyran-2-one lactone ring.	The ring-opened hydroxy acids of structural formula II above are intermediates in the synthesis of the lactone compounds of formula I and may be used in their free acid form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal or amine salt in the pharmaceutical method of the present invention. These acids react to form pharmaceutically acceptable metal and amine salts. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable metal salt" contemplates salts formed with the sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, iron, and zinc ions. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable amine salt" contemplates salts with ammonia and organic nitrogenous bases strong enough to form salts with carboxylic acids. Bases useful for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic base addition salts of compounds of the present invention form a class whose limits are readily understood by those skilled in the art.	The free acid form of compounds of the present invention may be regenerated from the salt form, if desired, by contacting the salt with a dilute aqueous solution of an acid such as hydrochloric acid.	The base addition salts may differ from the free acid forms of the compounds of this invention in such physical characteristics as solubility and melting point, but are otherwise considered equivalent to the free acid form for the purposes of this invention.	The compounds of the present invention may exist in solvated or unsolvated form. In general, the solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like, are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of this invention.	The compounds of this invention are useful as hypocholesterolemic or hypolipidemic agents by virtue of their ability to inhibit the biosynthesis of cholesterol through inhibition of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase).	The ability of compounds of the present invention to inhibit the biosynthesis of cholesterol was measured by two methods. A first method (designated CSI screen) utilized the procedure described by R. E. Dugan et al., Archiv. Biochem. Biophys., (1972), 152, 21-27. In this method, the level of HMG-CoA enzyme activity in standard laboratory rats is increased by feeding the rats a chow diet containing 5% cholestyramine for four days, after which the rats are sacrificed.	The rat livers are homogenized, and the incorporation of cholesterol-14C-acetate into nonsaponifiable lipid by the rat liver homogenate is measured. The micromolar concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of sterol synthesis over a one-hour period is measured, and expressed as an IC50 value.	A second method (designated COR screen) employed the procedure detailed by T. Kita, et al., J. Clin. Invest., (1980), 66: 1094-1100. In this method, the amount of 14C-HMG-CoA converted to 14C-mevalonate in the presence of a purified enzyme preparation of HMG-CoA reductase was measured. The micromolar concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was measured and recorded as an IC50 value.	The activity of several representative examples of compounds in accordance with the present invention appears in Table 1, and is compared with that of the prior art compound, compactin.	For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersable granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories.	A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, or tablet disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating material.	In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active compound is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.	For preparing suppositories, a low-melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides and cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed therein by, for example, stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds and allowed to cool and solidify.	Powders and tablets preferably contain between about 5 to about 70% by weight of the active ingredient. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, lactose, sugar, pectin, dextrin, starch, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a low-melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like.	The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component (with or without other carriers) is	TABLE 1	__________________________________________________________________________	##STR7##	IC50	(Micromoles/liter)	Compound	X      R1  R2     R3    R4	CSI   COR	__________________________________________________________________________	1     CH2CH2	##STR8##	##STR9##	##STR10## CH(CH3)2	0.035 0.050	2     CH2CH2	##STR11##	##STR12##	##STR13## CF3	0.40  0.40	3     CH2CH2	##STR14##	##STR15##	##STR16## CF3	0.018 0.020	Compactin (Prior art)                               0.026 0.028	__________________________________________________________________________	surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. In a similar manner, cachets are also included. Tablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.	Liquid form preparations include solutions suitable for oral or parenteral administration, or suspensions and emulsions suitable for oral administration. Sterile water solutions of the active component or sterile solutions of the active component in solvents comprising water, ethanol, or propylene glycol may be mentioned as examples of liquid preparations suitable for parenteral administration.	Sterile solutions may be prepared by dissolving the active component in the desired solvent system, and then passing the resulting solution through a membrane filter to sterilize it or, alternatively, by dissolving the sterile compound in a previously sterilized solvent under sterile conditions.	Aqueous solutions for oral administration can be prepared by dissolving the active compound in water and adding suitable flavorants, coloring agents, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water together with a viscous material such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and other suspending agents known to the pharmaceutical formulation art.	Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of the preparation, for example, packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet, or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these packaged forms.	
US4681893_0004	In therapeutic use as hypolipidemic or hypocholesterolemic agents, the compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of this invention are administered to the patient at dosage levels of from 40 mg to 600 mg per day. For a normal human adult of approximately 70 kg or body weight, this translates to a dosage of from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 8.0 mg/kg of body weight per day.	The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. Determination of optimum dosages for a particular situation is within the skill of the art.	The following examples illustrate particular methods for preparing compounds in accordance with this invention. These examples are illustrative and are not to be read as limiting the scope of the invention as it is defined by the appended claims.

The invention provides crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate, processes for its preparation, compositions containing the same and its therapeutic use as an anti-depressant.	This invention relates to crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride, its preparation and its use as a therapeutic agent.	U.S. Pat. No. 4,007,196 discloses a class of compounds that are inhibitors of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) uptake and thus of therapeutic use as anti-depressants. In Example 2 of the U.S. patent there is described the preparation of (-)-trans-4-(4'-fluorophenyl) 3-(3'4'-methylenedioxyphenoxymethyl)-piperidine of formula A: ##STR1##	In this specification the compound of formula A is referred to by its generic name of paroxetine.	Because of its basicity, it is preferred that paroxetine is used as a therapeutic agent in the form of an acid addition salt. In Example 2 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,007,196, paroxetine is obtained as the free base and then converted to its maleic acid salt.	The acetate salt of paroxetine has been used in most of the published experimental trials [for example, Psychopharmacology, 57, 151-153 (1978); ibid. 68, 229-233 (1980); and European Journal of Pharmacology, 47 (1978) 351-358]. There has also been limited use of the hydrochloride salt (in aqueous solution) [Acta. Pharmacol. et Toxicol. 1979, 44, 289-295]. However, the preparation of paroxetine hydrochloride has not been described in the literature.	In general, the hydrochloride salt of a basic compound is preferred for therapeutic use because of its physiological acceptability.	However for commercial use it is also important that the solid product should have good handling qualities.	We have found that amorphous paroxetine hydrochloride is a hygroscopic solid of poor handling qualities.	It has now been discovered that paroxetine hydrochloride can be produced in crystalline form in a manner reproducible on a commercial scale.	The present invention provides crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate as a novel material, in particular in pharmaceutically acceptable form.	Paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate is stable and non-hygroscopic. It is characterised by an X-ray powder diffractogram as shown in the accompanying FIG. 1. A typical Nujol infra-red spectrum (FIG. 2) and DSC profile (prepared using a 2.26 mg sample in a sealed container (FIG. 3) is also shown. Under extreme dessication conditions the bound water may be removed to give an anhydrous form, but on rehydration it rapidly reforms the hemihydrate.	The present invention also provides a process for producing crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate which comprises forming a solution of paroxetine hydrochloride and precipitating the crystalline form from solution.	The solution may be formed by dissolution of pre-formed paroxetine hydrochloride or by forming the hydrochloride in situ. The hydrochloride may be formed from a solution of paroxetine free base or a salt other than the hydrochloride by contacting it with hydrogen chloride.	For example a solution of hydrogen chloride, for example concentrated hydrochloric acid or an organic solvent saturated with hydrogen chloride may be added to a solution of paroxetine salt. Alternatively hydrogen chloride gas may be passed through the paroxetine (salt) solution.	Paroxetine base may be prepared by the procedure disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,007,196. The U.S. Patent also gives procedures for preparing salts of paroxetine with various organic acids.	Typically, paroxetine hydrochloride may be obtained from an organic solution e.g. in toluene, of the free base by adding an appropiate amount of aqueous HCl.	In a procedure using a salt, paroxetine hydrochloride may be produced from a paroxetine C1-5 carboxylate such as the acetate. The acetate may be obtained by reaction of acetic acid and paroxetine base in a non-polar solvent, such as diethyl ether or isopropyl ether. Alternatively it may be obtained from an aqueous solution obtained by extraction from a water-immiscible solvent e.g. toluene, ethyl acetate, by the addition of water and an appropriate amount of acetic acid.	Before conversion to the hydrochloride or crystallisation it may be desirable to remove impurities, since it has been found that some impurities may act as crystallisation inhibitors. However, the hemihydrate can even be obtained from relatively impure starting material, by means of seeding.	Paroxetine hydrochloride may be obtained as a crystalline hemihydrate by crystallization after addition of an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid to a solution of paroxetine free base in water immiscible solvents e.g. toluene, or by crystallisation from water miscible solvents which do not form a solvate (e.g. IMS) after adding aqueous hydrochloric acid to a solution of the free base or by crystallising or recrystallising paroxetine hydrochloride from a solvent system containing water e.g. IMS/water. Alternatively the hydrochloride hemihydrate can be produced via another paroxetine salt by the addition of hydrochloric acid to an aqueous solution of the salt e.g. acetate.	In a preferred aspect, this invention provides paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate which is substantially pure.	The hemihydrate can be obtained by crystallisation from a range of solvents, although seeding may be necessary in some instances, after addition of aqueous HCl to a solution of the free base or another salt. Solvents which have been found suitable are toluene, water, IMS, lower alcohols such as ethanol and isopropanol and ethyl acetate. The same solvent range may be used for recrystallizatation.	In a particular aspect of the invention, paroxetine free base is synthesised in a particularly pure form which is especially suitable for use in the preparation of the crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate of the invention, even without seeding.	In the above mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 4,007,196, for the preparation of paroxetine (Examples 1 and 2), an N-methyl compound is reacted with phenyl chloroformate and the resultant compound is hydrolysed with potassium hydroxide.	One disadvantage of this process is that the solvent used during the hydrolysis step (methyl cellosolve) leads to the production of unwanted transesterification by-products.	We have now discovered that the purity of the final product can be improved by using a different solvent during the hydrolysis step, such as toluene. A further advantage is that the temperature at which the hydrolysis is carried out can thus be reduced, owing to the reduction in boiling point of the solvent used.	The pure paroxetine free base thus obtained can then be used for the preparation of crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate as set out above.	In a further aspect of the invention, crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate can be obtained by compressing crystalline paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate.	In a still further particular aspect of the invention, paroxetine is synthesised directly as its hydrochloride salt, followed by crystallization as set out above.	We have discovered a new process for the preparation of paroxetine and related compounds by a de-acylation procedure which advantageously provides the desirable hydrochloride salt directly.	Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I ##STR2## in which R2 represents an alkyl or alkynyl group having 1-4 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group optionally substituted by C1-4 alkyl, C1-6 alkylthio, C1-6 alkoxy, halogen, nitro, acylamino, methylsulfonyl or methylenedioxy, or represents tetrahydronaphthyl, and X represents hydrogen, alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms, C1-6 alkoxy, C1-6 trifluoroalkyl (preferably, trifluoromethyl), hydroxy, halogen, methylthio, or aryl(C1-6)alkyloxy (e.g., phenyl(C1-6)alkyloxy and benzyl(C1-6)alkyloxy) by de-acylating a compound of formula II ##STR3## in which R1 is a C1-6 alkyl group and X is as defined for formula I.	The de-acylation may be achieved by heating the compound of formula II in a lower alcohol e.g. methanol. Preferably R1 is a methyl group.	The de-acylation is advantageously carried out as the final step of a procedure for de-alkylating a compound of formula III ##STR4## in which R3 is a C1-6 alkyl group and X is as defined for formula I.	The replacement of R3 by R1.CHClO.CO to convert the compound of formula III to the compound of formula II may be achieved by reacting the compound of formula III with α-chloro-ethyl chloroformate in a solvent such as dichloroethane or toluene.	Alternatively, the compound of formula III may be reacted with vinyl chloroformate in a solvent such as methylene dichloride or toluene to obtain the intermediate of formula IV ##STR5## wherein X and R2 are as defined for formula I, which is then treated with HCl, preferably by passing HCl gas through the solution to obtain the compound of formula II.	An advantageous feature of this process is that the conversion of the compound of formula III into the compound of formula I can be carried out as a `one-pot` process without isolating the intermediate of formula II or the intermediate of formula IV if the alternative route is followed.	The compounds of formula III may be prepared by the procedures set out in U.S. Pat. No. 4,007,196.	Advantageously, the process is used for the de-alkylation of a compound of formula IIIa to obtain paroxetine hyrochloride of formula Ia. This procedure is illustrated in the following reaction scheme. ##STR6##	
US4721723_0003	The intermediates having the general formulae II and IV given above are novel compounds. They form part of the present invention, together with the processes for their preparation described herein.

No. 4,007,196, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Such composition is normally taken from 1 to 6 times daily, for example 2, 3 or 4 times daily so that the total amount of active agent administered is within the range 5 to 400 mg.

This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 640,020, filed on 8/10/84, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 586,107, filed on Mar. 5, 1984, now abandoned.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION	The invention relates to novel salts of the known compound omeprazole.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	The compound known under the generic name omeprazole, having the structural formula ##STR2## which is described i.a. in European patent specification 0005129, is being extensively investigated clinically as a gastric acid secretion inhibiting agent.	Omeprazole is useful for inhibiting gastric acid secretion as well as for providing gastrointestinal cytoprotective effects in mammals and man. In a more general sense, omeprazole may be used for prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases in mammals and man, including e.g. gastritis, gastric ulcer, and duodenal ulcer. Furthermore, omeprazole may be used for prevention and treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders where cytoprotective and/or gastric antisecretory effect is desirable, e.g. in patients with gastrinomas, in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and in patients with a history of chronic and excessive alcohol consumption.	The term "omeprazole" as used in this specification designates the neutral form of the compound of the formula (i), that is the form as given in the formula (i) without salt forming components present. A problem with omeprazole is its stability characteristics. Upon storage without any special precautions being taken, it is degraded at a rate which is higher than desired. A storage during accelerated conditions, that is at +37° C. and at a relative humidity of 80% for a period of 6 months, about 6% of the substance is converted to degradation products. While the rate of decomposition of omeprazole at normal storage conditions is lower, it is nevertheless desirable to obtain physical forms of omeprazole which exhibit improved stability. This need for more stable forms of omeprazole is apparent when considering the often considerable time periods involved from the synthesis of the active substance through its incorporation in pharmaceutical preparations, distribution of the finished product to pharmacies etc. up to the consumption of the preparation by the patient. The present invention provides such new forms of omeprazole which exhibit improved storage stability.	THE INVENTION	It has been found that the novel alkaline salts of omeprazole with the structural formula ##STR3## wherein n is 1,2, or 4; An+ is Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ti4+, N+ (R1)4 or ##STR4## wherein R1 is an alkyl group containing 1-4 carbon atoms are more stable during storage than the corresponding neutral form of omeprazole. The salts of the formula I are also easier to handle than the neutral form in the manufacture of pharmaceutical dosage units.	A preferred group of omeprazole salts of the formula I are those wherein An+ is Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+.	Further preferred salts are those wherein An+ is Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+. The Na+ -salt is especially preferred for the preparation of liquid pharmaceutical formulations, e.g. solutions for intravenous administration. The Mg2+ and Ca2+ salts are especially preferred for the preparation of tablets. The Mg2+ salt is particularly preferred.	Illustrative examples of the alkyl group R1 are CH3, C2H5, n-C3H7, and n-C4H9.	The novel salts I of the invention are prepared by reacting omeprazole of the formula ##STR5## with a base capable of releasing the cation	An+                                                   (ii)	wherein An+ is as defined above,	to give a salt of the formula ##STR6## which salt is thereafter isolated.	Examples of bases capable of releasing the cation An+, and examples of reaction conditions are given below.	(a) Salts of the formula I wherein A is Li, Na or K are prepared by treating omeprazole with LiOH, NaOH or KOH in an aqueous or nonaqueous medium or with LiOR, LiNH2, LiNR2, NaOR, NaNH2, NaNR2, KOR, KNH2 or KNR2, wherein R is an alkyl group containing 1-4 carbon atoms, in a nonaqueous medium.	(b) Salts of the formula I wherein A is Mg, Ca, or Ti are prepared by treating omeprazole with Mg(OR)2, Ca(OR)2, CaH2, Ti(OR)4 or TiH4, wherein R is an alkyl group containing 1-4 carbon atoms, in a nonaqueous solvent such as an alcohol (only for the alcoholates), e.g. ROH, or in an ether such as tetrahydrofuran. (c) Salts of the formula I wherein A is ##STR7## are prepared by treating omeprazole with the strong base ##STR8## dissolved in a solvent, for example an alcohol.	(d) A salt of formula I may be converted to another salt of the same formula by exchanging the cation. When both the starting material and the salt obtained as final product are sufficiently soluble, such an exchange may be performed by using a cation-exchange resin saturated with the cation desired in the product. The exchange may also be performed by utilizing the low solubility of a desired salt. By this principle, for example, Na+ as a counter ion may be exchanged for Ca2+ or Mg2+.	(e) The reaction between the compounds (i) and (ii) may also be carried out by ion-pair extraction. For example, tetrabutylammonium salts of the invention may be prepared by dissolving the Na+ -salt in water containing tetrabutylammonium sulfate followed by extraction of the tetrabutylammonium salt I into a methylene chloride phase, and subsequent isolation of the tetrabutylammonium salt I. In this manner also other tetraalkylammonium salts I may be prepared.	Illustrative examples of the radical R are CH3, C2H5, n-C3H7, n-C4H9, i-C4H9, sec.-C4H9 and tert.-C4H9.	The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing a novel salt of omeprazole as active ingredient; to the use of the novel omeprazolesalts for providing local gastrointestinal cytoprotective effects in mammals and man; to the use of the novel omeprazole salts in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases in mammals and man; to the use of the novel omeprazole salts for inhibiting gastric acid secretion in mammals and man; to a method for inhibiting gastric acid secretion in mammals and man by administering a compound of the formula I; to a method for the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases in mammals and man by administering a compound of the formula I; and to a method for providing gastrointestinal cytoprotective effects in mammals and man by orally administering a compound of the formula I.	For clinical use the compounds of the invention are formulated into pharmaceutical formulations for oral, rectal, parenteral or other mode of administration; however only oral administration is suitable for providing gastrointestinal cytoprotective effects. The pharmaceutical formulation contains a compound of the invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be in the form of a solid, semi-solid or liquid diluent, or a capsule. These pharmaceutical preparations are a further aspect of the invention. Usually the amount of active compound is between 0.1-95% by weight of the preparation, between 0.2-20% by weight in preparations for parenteral use and between 1 and 50% by weight in preparations for oral administration.	
US4738974_0003	In the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of the present invention in the form of dosage units for oral administration the compound selected may be mixed with a solid, powdered carrier, e.g. lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starch, amylopectin, cellulose derivatives or gelatin, as well as with lubricating agents e.g. magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, sodium steryl fumarate and polyethylene glycol waxes. The mixture is then processed into granules or pressed into tablets. Since the compounds of the invention are susceptible to degradation in acid to neutral media, the above-mentioned granules or tablets when used for gastric acid inhibition are preferably coated with an enteric coating which protects the active compound from acid degradation as long as the dosage form remains in the stomach. The enteric coating is chosen among pharmaceutically acceptable enteric-coating materials e.g. beeswax, shellac or anionic film-forming polymers such as cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, partly methyl esterified methacrylic acid polymers and the like, if preferred in combination with a suitable plasticizer. To this coating various dyes may be added in order to distinguish among tablets or granules with different active compounds or with different amounts of the active compound present.	Soft gelatine capsules may be prepared with capsules containing a mixture of the active compound or compounds of the invention, vegetable oil, fat, or other suitable vehicle for soft gelatine capsules. Soft gelatine capsules are preferably enteric coated as described above. Hard gelatine capsules may contain enteric-coated granules of the active compound. Hard gelatine capsules may also contain the active compound in combination with a solid powdered carrier e.g. lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, potato starch, corn starch, amylopectin, cellulose derivatives or gelatine; the hard gelatine capsules are preferably enteric coated as described above. In orally administering the compounds of the invention to provide gastrointestinal cytoprotective effects in mammals and man non-enteric coated oral dosage forms are usually preferred, however in order to achieve intestinal cytoprotection enteric coated dosage forms may be needed.	Dosage units for rectal administration may be prepared in the form of suppositories which contain the active substance mixed with a neutral fat base, or they may be prepared in the form of a gelatine rectal capsule which contains the active substance in a mixture with a vegetable oil, paraffin oil or other suitable vehicle for gelatine rectal capsules, or they may be prepared in the form of a ready-made micro enema, or they may be prepared in the form of a dry micro enema formulation to be reconstituted in a suitable solvent just prior to administration.	Liquid preparations for oral administration may be prepared in the form of syrups or suspensions, e.g. solutions or suspensions containing from 0.2% to 20% by weight of the active ingredient and the remainder consisting of sugar or sugar alcohols and a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol, propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol. If desired, such liquid preparations may contain colouring agents, flavouring agents, saccharine and carboxymethyl cellulose and thickening agent. Liquid preparations for oral administration may also be prepared in the form of a dry powder to be reconstituted with a suitable solvent prior to use.	Solutions for parenteral administration may be prepared as a solution of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, preferably in a concentration from 0.1% to 10% by weight. These solutions may also contain stabilising agents and/or buffering agents and may be manufactured in unit dose ampoules or vials. Solutions for parenteral administration may also be prepared as a dry preparation to be reconstituted with a suitable solvent extemporaneously before use. Sodium salts of the invention are preferably used in the preparation of parenteral formulations.	The typical daily dose of the active substance varies within a wide range and will depend on various factors such as for example the individual requirement of each patient, the manner of administration and the disease. In general, oral and parenteral dosages will be in the range of 5 to 400 mg per day of active substance.	The following examples will further illustrate the invention.

Cyano compounds of formula XVIII ##STR22## may be prepared from cyano compounds of formula XII by for example the following series of reactions	(a) hydrolysis of the cyano group to form a carboxylic acid of formula XIV;	(b) reduction of the carboxylic acid for example with lithium aluminium hydride or borane-dimethylsulphide complex to form the corresponding alcohol;	(c) replacement of the hydroxy group of the alcohol by a leaving group for example a p-toluene sulphonyloxy group and	(d) replacement of the leaving group with a cyano group. Cyano compounds of formula XVI in which one or both of R1 and R2 are other than H may be prepared from the corresponding cyano compounds of formula XVI in which R1 and/or R2 are H, for example by alkylation with an alkyl halide in the presence of a base such as lithium diisopropylamide.	Cyano compounds of formula XVI in which R2 =H may also be prepared by reacting ketones of formula V with a reagent for introducing a cyano group such as p-toluenesulphonylmethyl isocyanide.	Acid chlorides of formula XIII and IX may be prepared by the reaction of carboxylic acids of formula XIV and X respectively with for example thionyl chloride.	Aldehydes of formula XV may be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. The following are given as examples of suitable methods:	(a) by the reduction of cyano compounds of formula XII with for example di-tert-butylaluminium hydride or diisobutylaluminium hydride.	(b) by the reduction of carboxylic acid derivatives, for example	(i) by the reduction of tertiary amides formed by the reaction of secondary amines with acid chlorides of formula XIII for example when the secondary amine is a dialkylamine using lithium diethoxyaluminohydride as reducing agent or when the secondary amine is ethyleneimine using lithium aluminium hydride as the reducing agent,	(ii) by the reduction of acid chlorides of formula XIII for example with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminohydride.	(c) by the oxidation of alcohols (prepared by the reduction of carboxylic acids of formula XIV) with, for example, chromium trioxide-pyridine complex in dichloromethane under anhydrous conditions.	Ketones of formula V (except those in which R5 and R6 are H and R1 is methyl or ethyl), the compounds of formula VI (except those in which Z is CR1 =NY and R5 and R6 are H and R1 is methyl and ethyl), the imines of formula VII (except those in which R5 and R6 are H), and XI (except those in which R5 and R6 are H and R1 is methyl or ethyl), the amides of formula VIII, the carboxylic acids of formula X (except those in which R1, R2, R5 and R6 are H), the cyano compounds of formula XVI and the acid chlorides of formula IX (except those in which R1, R2, R5 and R6 are H) which are described herein as intermediates are novel compounds. Some of the cyano compounds of formula XII and XVII are novel compounds. Such novel compounds form a further aspect of the present invention.	Novel formamides of formula XIX ##STR23## are described herein as intermediates, in the preparation of compounds of formula I and such novel formamides form a further aspect of the present invention.	The therapeutic activity of the compounds of formula I has been indicated by assessing the ability of the compounds to reverse the hypothermic effects of reserpine in the following manner. Male mice of the Charles River CD1 strain weighing between 18 and 30 grammes were separated into groups of five and were supplied with food and water ad libitum. After five hours the body temperature of each mouse was taken orally and the mice were injected intraperitoneally with reserpine (5 mg/kg) in solution in deionised water containing ascorbic acid (50 mg/ml). The amount of liquid injected was 10 ml/kg of body weight. Nine hours after the start of the test food was withdrawn but water was still available ad libitum. Twenty-four hours after the start of the test the temperatures of the mice were taken and the mice were given the test compound suspended in a 0.25% solution of hydroxy ethyl cellulose (sold under the trade name Cellosize QP 15000 by Union Carbide) in deionised water at a dose volume of 10 ml/kg of body weight. Three hours later the temperatures of all the mice were again taken. The percentage reversal of the reserpine-induced loss of body temperature is then calculated by the formula: ##EQU1## The mean value for each group of five mice was taken at several dose rates to enable a value of the mean dose which causes a 50% reversal (ED50) to be obtained. All the compounds which are the final products of the Examples hereinafter gave values of ED50 of 30 mg/kg or less. It is widely understood by those skilled in the art that this test is indicative of compounds having antidepressant activity in humans.	Table I lists compounds of formula I which gave a value of ED50 in the above test of 10 mg/kg or less.

All compounds were characterised by conventional analytical techniques and gave satisfactory elemental analyses. All melting and boiling points are expressed in degrees Celsius.	EXAMPLE 1	A solution of 3,4-dichlorobenzyl cyanide (25 g) and 1,3-dibromopropane (15 ml) in dry dimethyl sulphoxide (150 ml) was added dropwise under nitrogen to a stirred mixture of sodium hydride (7.5 g) dispersed in mineral oil (7.5 g) and dimethylsulphoxide (200 ml) at a temperature in the range 30° to 35° C. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for two hours and propan-2-ol (8 ml) and then water (110 ml) were added dropwise. The mixture was filtered through a diatomaceous earth sold under the Registered Trade Mark CELITE and the solid residue washed with ether. The ether layer was separated, washed with water, dried and evaporated. 1-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-1-cyclobutanecarbonitrile (b.p. 108°-120° C. at 0.15 Hg) was isolated by distillation. This method is a modification of that described by Butler and Pollatz (J.Org.Chem., Vol. 36, No. 9, 1971, p. 1308).	The 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-cyclobutanecarbonitrile prepared as above (21.7 g) was dissolved in dry ether (50 ml) and the solution was added under nitrogen to the product of the reaction of gaseous methyl bromide with magnesium turnings (3.9 g) in dry ether (150 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for two hours and then under reflux for two hours. Crushed ice and then concentrated hydrochloric acid (100 ml) were added and the mixture heated under reflux for two hours. The ether layer was separated, washed with water and aqueous sodium bicarbonate, dried and evaporated. 1-Acetyl-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutane (b.p. 108°-110° at 0.2 mm Hg) was isolated by distillation.	1-Acetyl-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutane (9.1 g) prepared as above, formamide (6.5 ml) and 98% formic acid (3 ml) were heated at 180° C. for sixteen hours to give N-formyl-1-[1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]ethylamine. Concentrated hydrochloric acid (20 ml) was added and the mixture heated under reflux for three hours. The solution was then cooled, washed with ether and sodium hydroxide solution added. The product was extracted with ether, and the ether extract washed with water, dried and evaporated. 1-[1-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]ethylamine (b.p. 112°-118° at 0.2 mm Hg) was isolated by distillation. The amine was dissolved in propan-2-ol and concentrated hydrochloric acid and the solution evaporated to dryness to give 1-[1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]ethylamine hydrochloride (m.p. 185°-195° C.). (Formula I R1 =Me; R2, R3 and R4 =H; R5 =4-Cl; R6 =3-Cl).	EXAMPLE 1a	The preparation of N-formyl-1-[1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]ethylamine (m.p. 124°-125° C.) (Example 1(a) Formula I R1 =Me; R2 =H; R3 =H; R4 =CHO; R5 =4-Cl and R6 =3-Cl) described above was repeated and the product isolated by cooling the reaction mixture and collecting the solid produced by filtration. The formamide was then hydrolysed by concentrated hydrochloric acid in industrial methylated spirit to give the hydrochloride salt of 1-[1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]ethylamine.	In a similar manner to that described above in Example Ia the following compounds were prepared. The conditions for the hydrolysis of the formamides which were isolated by appropriate methods are shown in the footnotes.	______________________________________	##STR24##	m.p. of	Example	R1R5	R6	b.p.

EXAMPLE 2	The product of Example 1 (4.04 g), water (0.5 ml) and 98% formic acid (3.6 ml) were mixed with cooling. 37-40% Aqueous formaldehyde (3.8 ml) was added and the solution was heated at 85°-95° C. for five hours. The solution was evaporated to dryness and the residue acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the water removed by repeated addition of propan-2-ol followed by evaporation in vacuo.

EXAMPLE 4	1-Acetyl-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutane (15 g) prepared as described in Example 1, N-methylformamide (47.5 ml) 98% formic acid (10.3 ml) and a 25% aqueous solution of methylamine (1.5 ml) were mixed and heated with stirring at 170°-180° for eight hours. The mixture was cooled and extracted with ether. The ether extract was washed, dried and evaporated to yield a light yellow oil which was heated under reflux with concentrated hydrochloric acid (50 ml) for two hours. Industrial methylated spirit (IMS) (50 ml) was added and the mixture heated under reflux for sixteen hours. The mixture was then cooled to 0° C. and the white precipitate collected by filtration, washed with acetone and dried. The product, N-methyl-1-[1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]ethylamine hydrochloride, had a melting point of 254° to 256° C. (Formula I R1 =Me; R2 =H; R3 =Me; R4 =H; R5 =4-Cl and R6 =3-Cl).

US4746680_0007	______________________________________	Note A	The starting ketone was prepared in tetrahydrofuran as reaction solvent i	place of ether.	EXAMPLE 5	A mixture of 70% aqueous ethylamine (50 ml) and water (100 ml) was gradually mixed with a mixture of 98% formic acid (50 ml) and water (100 ml) to give a neutral solution which was evaporated at 100° C./100 mm Hg until 180 ml of water had been collected. The residue was heated to 140° C. and 1-acetyl-1-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclobutane (10.4 g) prepared in a similar manner to that described in Example 1 for 1-acetyl-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutane and 98% formic acid (10 ml) were added. The mixture was heated on an oil bath at a temperature of 180°-200° C. for sixteen hours. The mixture was distilled until an internal temperature of 170° C. was obtained and this temperature was maintained for two hours. Any volatile material was removed by distillation at 160° C./20 mm and the residue heated under reflux with concentrated hydrochloric acid (15 ml) and industrial methylated spirit (IMS) (15 ml) for three hours. The IMS was evaporated on a rotary evaporator and the residue washed with ether. The aqueous phase was brought to pH 12 with sodium hydroxide and extracted with ether. The ether extract was dried and on evaporation yielded a residue which was treated with aqueous hydrochloric acid to give N-ethyl-1-[1-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]ethylamine hydrochloride (m.p. 203°-205° C.) (Formula I R1 =Me; R2 =H; R3 =Et; R4 =H; R5 =4-Cl; R6 =H).	EXAMPLE 6	1-(4-Chlorophenyl)-1-cyclobutanecarbonitrile (15 g) prepared in a similar manner to the 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutanecarbonitrile of Example 1 in dry ether (50 ml) was added to the product of the reaction between magnesium turnings (3.18 g) and propyl bromide (15.99 g) in dry ether (50 ml). The ether was replaced by tetrahydrofuran and the mixture heated with stirring under reflux for eighteen hours. The mixture was cooled and ice and then concentrated hydrochloric acid (52 ml) added. The resulting mixture was stirred under reflux for ten hours and extracted with ether. The ether extract yielded a residue from which 1-butyryl-1-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclobutane (b.p. 106°-108°/0.3 mm Hg) was distilled.	A mixture of the ketone produced as described above (21 g) and 98% formic acid (6 ml) was added over a period of one and a half hours to formamide (15 ml) at 160° C. After completion of the addition the temperature was raised to 180° to 185° C. and maintained in this range for five hours. The mixture was cooled and extracted with chloroform to yield a thick gum which on heating with petroleum ether (b.p. 60°-80°) gave a colourless solid which was recrystallised from petroleum ether (b.p. 60°-80°) to yield N-formyl-1-[1-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]butylamine (m.p. 97.5° to 98.5° C.) (Formula I R1 =propyl; R2 =H; R3 =H; R4 =CHO; R5 =4-Cl; R6 =H).	EXAMPLE 7	A solution of 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-cyclobutanecarbonitrile prepared as described in Example 1 (35.2 g) in ether (100 ml) was added to a solution of propyl magnesium bromide prepared by the reaction of propyl bromide (32 g) with magnesium turnings (6.36 g) in ether (100 ml). The ether was replaced by dry toluene and the mixture heated under reflux for one hour. Water (200 ml) and then concentrated hydrochloric acid (120 ml) were added and the mixture heated under reflux for one hour. The reaction mixture was extracted with ether and after washing and drying the extract yielded a residue from which 1-butyryl-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutane (b.p. 120°-128° C. at 0.25 mm) was distilled.	The ketone produced as described above (37.0 g) and 98% formic acid (9 ml) were added to formamide (23.5 ml) at 170° C. and the temperature kept at 175°-180° C. for five hours. A further portion of formic acid (4.5 ml) was added and the mixture was maintained at 175°-180° C. for a further fifteen hours. The mixture was extracted with ether which on evaporation gave a thick oil which was crystallised from petroleum ether (b.p. 60°-80°) to give N-formyl-1-[1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]butylamine having a melting point of 103°-105° C. (Formula I R1 =propyl; R2 =H; R3 =H; R4 =CHO; R5 =4-Cl and R6 =3-Cl).

The mixture was heated under reflux for five hours and then cooled. Water (15 ml) and then 10% sodium hydroxide solution (3 ml) were added and the mixture filtered through diatomaceous earth sold under the Registered Trade Mark CELITE. The product was extracted into ether, back extracted into 5N hydrochloric acid and the aqueous layer was basified and extracted with ether. The ether extract yielded an oil which was dissolved in propan-2-ol (5 ml) and concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to pH 2. Evaporation of the resulting solution gave a white solid which was collected, washed with acetone and dried. The product was N-methyl-1-[1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]butylamine hydrochloride and had a melting point of 234°-235° C. (Formula I R1 =propyl; R2 =H; R3 =H; R4 =Me; R5 =4-Cl and R6 =3-Cl).

The mixture was stirred at this temperature for four hours. Water (25 ml) was added dropwise with cooling and the mixture filtered through diatomaceous earth (CELITE). Aqueous NaOH was added and an ether extraction performed. The ether extract was washed with water and back extracted with 5N hydrochloric acid. A white solid (m.p. 232°-235° C.) appeared at the interface which was collected. Base was added to the aqueous phase and a further ether extraction performed. Evaporation of the ether extract yielded an oil which was dissolved in propan-2-ol (5 ml) and concentrated hydrochloric acid added to pH 2. Evaporation to dryness gave a white solid (m.p. 233°-236° C.). The white solids were combined and recrystallised from propan-2-ol to yield N-methyl-1-[1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]butylamine hydrochloride (m.p. 236°-237° C.) (Formula I R1 =propyl; R2 =H; R3 =H; R4 =Me; R5 =4-Cl and R6 =3-Cl).	In a similar manner to that described above the following compounds were prepared. Where the formyl starting material was insoluble in ether, a solution of the reducing agent was added to a stirred suspension of the formyl compound. As the size of the group R1 is increased the hydrochloride salts of the desired compounds become less soluble in the aqueous phase and more soluble in the organic phase so that appropriate modifications in the isolation procedure are required as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.	______________________________________	##STR29##	Example R1      R5  R6	m.p.	______________________________________	9(a)    isopropyl    Cl       H      257-259°	9(b)    sec-butyl    Cl       H      209-212°	9(c)    isobutyl     Cl       H      225-233°	9(d)    cyclopentyl  Cl       H      252-256°	9(e)    n-hexyl      Cl       H      117-118°	9(f)    4-methoxyphenyl	Cl       H      264-266°	9(g)    3-methoxyphenyl

The solution was washed with ether and aqueous NaOH added before an ether extraction was performed. The ether extract was washed with brine and water and yielded an oil on evaporation. The oil (B 3.19 g) was dissolved in a mixture of propan-2-ol (4 ml) and ether (20 ml) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (1.5 ml) added. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo.

The reaction mixture was poured into an ice/water mixture and the resulting solution was washed with ether. The aqueous layer was added to a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid (100 ml) and ice and the resulting precipitate of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (m.p. 86°-88°) collected, washed with water and dried.	A solution of the acid (10.5 g) prepared as above in tetrahydrofuran (150 ml) was added dropwise under nitrogen to a stirred suspension of lithium aluminium hydride (2 g) in tetrahydrofuran (150 ml). The mixture was stirred under reflux for two hours and water added. The mixture was filtered through diatomaceous earth (CELITE-RTM) and the product extracted into ether. After washing with water and drying, the ether was evaporated to give a residue which was recrystallised from petroleum ether (b.p. 60°-80°). The product was 1-[1-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]methyl alcohol (m.p. 60°-62°C.).	A solution of the alcohol prepared as described above (60 g) in pyridine (52 ml) was added dropwise to a solution of p-toluenesulphonylchloride (60 g) in pyridine (100 ml) cooled in ice.

Jacobs & Jacobs	Iodotamoxifen derivatives which are compounds of formula (3) ##STR1## wherein X represents 3- or 4- iodo and R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, represent C1-3 alkyl, especially methyl or ethyl, groups or R1 represents a hydrogen atom and R2 a C1-3 alkyl group or R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a saturated heterocyclic group, especially a pyrrolidino, piperidino, 4-methylpiperidino or morpholino group, and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are potent anti-estrogenic compounds useful for treatment of estrogen receptor-positive (hormone-dependent) breast cancers.	Radioisotopic iodotamoxifen derivatives of formula (3) are useful in radiotherapy or gamma ray imaging of these cancers.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	1. Field of the invention	This invention relates to derivatives of tamoxifen, their preparation and use in therapy and diagnosis of breast cancer.	2. Description of prior art	Tamoxifen is Z (1,2-diphenyl)-1-[4-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)-phenyl]-1-butene of formula (1) ##STR2##	Its anti-estrogenic properties have led since 1971 to its clinical use in the treatment of malignant tumors, especially estrogen receptor-positive (hormone-dependent) breast cancer.	Tamoxifen has a relatively low affinity for the estrogen receptor (ER). Attempts have therefore been made to find tamoxifen derivatives having improved ER affinity. Changes have been made in virtually every part of the molecule. One derivative which at first seemed promising was the 4-hydroxy derivative of formulat (2) ##STR3## in which X=--OH. This compound was shown by in vitro tests to be a potent anti-estrogen, but unfortunately proved in vivo to be less effective than tamoxifen, owing to rapid glucuronidation of the hydroxyl group followed by excretion.	Several derivatives of tamoxifen are known which have other 4-position substituents, in which X is methoxy, methyl, fluoro or chloro. These compounds have been evaluated by K. E. Allen et al., British Journal of Pharmacology 71, 83-91 (1980). The methyl, chloro and fluoro derivatives were of particular interest as they are unlikely to be metabolised to the 4-hydroxy derivative and thence glucuronidated. An in vitro test of estrogen receptor affinity indicated that tamoxifen was approximately equiactive with its 4-methyl, fluoro- and chloro-derivatives. In vivo rat uterine weight tests indicated that these derivatives has lower anti-estrogenic activity than tamoxifen. Other tests indicated that the activity of the 4-methoxy derivative was about the same as tamoxifen.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	It has now been found that the 4-iodo derivative (formula 2: X=iodo) has greater potency than tamoxifen in relation to estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. In view of the report by K. E. Allen et al., supra, that the 4-fluoro and 4-chloro compounds are (at best) of no greater potency than tamoxifen, the present finding is most surprising. Also, the 4-bromo, 3-iodo and 3-bromo analogues show promise as alternatives to tamoxifen of at least equal potency.	These tamoxifen derivatives, which are named E 1-[4-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]-1-(3- and 4-iodophenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butene and E 1-[4-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]-1-(3- and 4-bromophenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butene, are believed to be new compounds. Analogues thereof in which the dimethylamino group is replaced by other dialkylamino groups or by monoalkylamino groups or a nitrogen-containing saturated heterocyclic ring are also believed to be novel and are potent against ER-positive breast cancer. Accordingly, the present invention provides 3- and 4-iodo and -bromotamoxifen derivatives which are compounds of formula (3) ##STR4## wherein X represents 3- or 4- iodo or bromo and the R1 and R2 symbols, which may be the same or different, represent C1-3 alkyl, especially methyl or ethyl, groups or R1 represents a hydrogen atom and R2 a C1-3 alkyl group or R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a saturated heterocyclic group, typically having 5 or 6 ring atoms, especially a pyrrolidino, piperidino, 4-methylpiperidino or morpholino group, and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.	The invention further includes:	the 3- and 4-iodo and -bromotamotamoxifen derivatives, i.e. the compounds of formula (3) and their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts for use in treatment of ER-positive breast cancer;	the 3- and 4-iodo and -bromotamoxifen derivatives for use in the preparation of a medicament for treatment of ER-positive breast cancer or, where national patent law permits, a method of treating such a cancer in a human patient which comprises administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of the tamoxifen derivative;	a pharmaceutical composition comprising a 3- or 4-iodo or -bromotamoxifen derivative in association with a pharmaceutically effective diluent, carrier or excipient;	a process for the preparation of the 3- and 4-iodo and -bromotamoxifen derivatives which comprises reacting 1-[4-(2-chloroethoxy)phenyl]-2-phenyl-1-butene with an organometallic reagent derived from 1,3- or 1,4-diiodo- or -dibromobenzene and capable of addition to a ketone group, in a substantially anhydrous organic solvent, to form a tertiary alcohol, dehydrating the tertiary alcohol to eliminate a molecule of water and thereby form 1-[4-(2- chloroethoxy)-phenyl]-1-(3- or 4-iodophenyl or -bromophenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butene as an isomeric mixture, separating the E isomer and reacting the E isomer with an amine of formula NR1R2, R1 and R2 being defined as above; and	a process for the preparation of the 3- and 4-iodo and -bromo tamoxifen derivatives which comprises reacting a ketone of formula (4) ##STR5## R1 and R2 beind defined as above, in one step with an organometallic reagent as defined above, in a substantially anhydous orgaic solvent, to form a tertiary alcohol, dehydrating the tertiary alcohol to eliminate a molecule of water and thereby form 1-[4-(2-NR1R2 -substituted ethoxy)phenyl]-1-(3- or 4-iodophenyl or 4-bromophenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butene as an isomeric mixture, and separating the E isomer.	The iodotamoxifen derivatives of the invention include per se those wherein the iodine atoms comprise radioisotopic iodine atoms. Predominantly useful such atoms are 125I for radiotherapy of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers and 131I and 123I which are gamma-emitters and therefore useful in imaging the tumours. These compounds, for such uses as well as per se, are part of the invention.	The radioisotopic iodotamoxifen derivatives can be prepared by a process comprising reacting a compound of formula ##STR6## wherein R1 and R2 are as defined in connction with formula (3) and Y represents a 3- or 4-substituent, whether an atom or a group, capable of being cleaved from its benzene ring (including within this definition a non-radioisotopic iodine atom), with a reagent capable of effecting such cleavage and with a source of radioisotopic iodine (which can be added as molecular iodine or iodide ions according to the cleavage-effecting reagent used and other reaction conditions). Preferably Y is chloro, bromo, iodo or amino.	DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS	The iodo derivatives are preferred to the bromo, and the 4-iodo to the 3-iodo. Preferably R1 and R2 are both alkyl groups, most preferably methyl, or NR1R2 is pyrrolidino.	The compounds of formula (3) and their salts are prepared starting from ketones which are known compounds. The preferred reagent for the preparation of the organometallic halobenzene species is n-butyllithium. Alternatively the magnesium Grignard reagent can be used. The immediate product of the organometallic reaction is a tertiary alcohol which is then dehydrated to eliminate a molecule of water and thereby provide the ethylenic double bond required. The dehydration is preferably carried out by heating the alcohol in a strong acid such as concentrated hydrochloric acid. A mixture of isomers is produced of which the desired one is that in which the ethyl group and the (2-aminoethoxy)phenyl group are trans. The Z/E nomenclature designates this as Z for tamoxifen itself and E for the iodo or bromo derivatives.	In one embodiment of the invention, the starting ketone already contains the (2-aminoethoxy)phenyl group and therefore the reaction can be carried out in one step (since the tertiary alcohol need not be isolated). The isomer separation is then carried out on the end product.	Alternatively, the starting ketone contains the (2-chloroethoxy)phenyl group. The dehydration to the olefin yields the (2-chloroethoxy)phenyl intermediate. The isomers can be separated by crystallisation, which is very convenient, and the desired E isomer appropriately aminated by reaction with the alkylamine or heterocyclic amine required. The amination can be carried out in any manner known in the synthesis of tamoxifen, for example heating the chloroethoxy intermediate with the amine in a sealed vessel.	The acid addition salts can be prepared in any manner analogous to those of taoxifen, at any appropriate stage of the overall synthesis after formation of the tertiary alcohol. Usually they will be prepared as the final stage. Examples of such salts are the hydrochloride, sulphate, phosphate, acetate and citrate. In the "direct" method of preparation of the iodo or bromotamoxifen derivatives, an acid addition salt is formed under the acidic dehydration conditions used. This will ordinarily be neutralised with, say, sodium hydroxide. The isomers can then be separated either as the free bases or, after adding a approximately stoichiometric proportion of acid, as acid addition salts.	For pharmaceutical formulation, the iodo and bromotamoxifen derivatives can be formulated in the same or a similar way to tamoxifen and administered similarly and in about the same dose. Preferably they are formulated as tablets.	The iodotamoxifen derivatives include those wherein the iodine atoms in some or all of the molecules of a given sample have a radioisotopic (a radioactive or "hot") iodine atom. Predominantly useful such atoms are 125I which emits low energy electrons having a short, sub-cellular range and 131I and 123I which emit gamma rays. The 125I isotopic iodine is useful in the therapy of tumour cels containing oestrogen receptors, in the same manner as has already been reported for another 125I tamoxifen derivative in which the iodine atom is attached to the same benzene ring as the 2-dimethylaminoethoxy group, in the ortho position thereto, see W. D. Bloomer et al., Int. J. Radiat. Biol, 38, 197-202 (1980). The 123I and 131I isotopes, of which 131I is preferred, are gamma emitters and therefore usable for imaging of oestrogen receptor-carrying tumour cells. The use of all these three isotopes in another iodotamoxifen, namely that in which the iodine atom is present in the "diagonally opposite" position to that of formula (3), that is to say is para in the benzene ring attached to the carbon atom to which the ethyl group is also attached, is suggested by D. H. Hunter et al., Can. J. Chem. 61, 421-426 (1983). The content of radioisotopic iodine in the iodotamoxifen formulation should be adjusted to conform to conventional radiotherapy and imaging practice.	The commonly used radioisotopes of iodine have a short half-life, for 131I 8 days, for 125I 60 days, and for 123I 13 hours. It is therefore necessary to prepare the radioisotopic compounds of the invention only shortly before the expected time of use. One suitable method of preparation, referred to above, starts from the corresponding compound substituted by non-radioactive ("cold") X (X=bromo or iodo) or by some other atom or group, for example chloro or amino, capable of undergoing a reaction in which the cold X or other atom or group is pulled off or cleaved from the benzene ring of the tamoxifen molecule.	In one aspect the starting compound is the "cold" iodotamoxifen, which is reacted with a copper (I) or (II) salt and an appropriate source of "hot" (radioisotopic) iodide such as sodium iodide. This a modified version of the Rosenmund-von Braun reaction in which an aryl iodide is convertible to the aryl cyanide by the action of copper (I) cyanide. Since this method does not give an iodotamoxifen product having a high proportion of its iodine atoms in radioisotopic form, it is not well suited to the production of iodotamoxifen for imaging purposes.	Another embodiment comprises reacting the starting compound containing the "cold" X with an alkyllithium and "hot" molecular iodine, in an inert atmosphere. The reaction mechanism is illustrated below using bromine as the cleavable atom and t-butyl lithium as the reagent which effects the cleavage. Ar denotes the residue of the tamoxifen molecule. ##STR7## Other alkyllithium reagents could be used in place of t-butyl lithium. The reaction takes place in a non-oxidising atmosphere in order to avoid production of a hydroxytamoxifen and a reducing atmosphere such as would react with molecular iodine is also to be avoided. An inert atmosphere is therefore the most suitable.	The reaction temperature can be any appropriate to the reaction equilibrium but is usually in the range of -80° to +20° C. A solvent is normally required and can be any appropriate to the temperature. Tetrahydrofuran is preferred at low temperatures. The iodine should be added in stoichiometric excess for the reaction. Preferably the radioisotopic iodine is added portionwise, less than the stoichiometric amount being added initially, whereby up to half of the radioisotopic I2 molecules added will become incorporated in the tamoxifen molecule. Addition of the remainder of the iodine, to a stoichiometric excess in total, as "cold" iodine will ensure that there is no avoidable wastage of the radioisotope. Of course, some of it (theoretically a half) will be wasted as iodide ions, which, however, can be recovered by methods known to those skilled in the raadioisotope art.	
US4839155_0003	It will be seen that the 4-bromotamoxifen derivatives of formula (3) are useful as intermediates in the preparation of radioisotopic 4-iodotamoxifen derivatives. When a 4-chlorotamoxifen is used as the starting compound, it can be prepared analogously to the 4-bromotamoxifen derivatives described herein. The amino group of the 4-amino analogue can be cleaved and iodine substituted by the action of hyponitrous acid and radiolabelled sodium iodide.	Another method proceeds via a tributyltin intermediate, which can be stored and then converted to the iodotamoxifen immediately before use. This intermediate can be prepared by reacting the 4-bromo- or iodotamoxifen derivative with n-butyllithium (as described above) and then with tributyl tin chloride. This method has been described by W. D. Bloomer et al., supra.	Other methods of introducing a radioactive iodine atom will be found in R. H. Seevers and R. E. Counsel, Chem. Rev. 82, 575-590 (1982) and such methods are usable mutatis mutandis in the context of the present invention.	The following Examples illustrate the invention. Examples 1-6 illustrate preparation of iodo and bromotamoxifen derivatives. "Ether" means diethyl ether. Examples 7 and 8 indicate antiestrogenic effects of the derivatives and Example 9 a pharmaceutical composition. Examples 10 and 11 illustrate preparation of radioisotopic iodotamoxifen derivatives.	EXAMPLE 1	Preparation of E 1-[4-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]-1-(4-iodophenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butene ("4-iodotamoxifen")	A stirred solution of 1,4-diiodobenzene (4.21 g, 12.7 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (20 ml) was cooled under nitrogen by a dry ice-acetone bath. n-Butyllithium (8.5 ml of a 1.55M solution in hexane, 12.7 mmol) was added. After 5 minutes, a solution of 1-[4-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]-2-phenyl-1-butanone (2.0 g, 6.4 mmol) was added and the mixture allowed to warm to room temperature. After 15 hours, the mixture was poured into water (60 ml) and extracted with ether (2×50 ml). The ether extracts were concentrated and the residual oil dissolved in ethanol (20 ml). Concentrated hydrochloric acid (10 ml) was added and the mixture heated under reflux for 4 hours, then cooled, and poured into water (100 ml). The solution was basified with aqueous sodium hydroxide (3M) and extracted with ether (100 ml). The ether extract was dried with sodium sulphate, concentrated, and the residue applied to a column of silica (Merck 15111, 80 g). Elution with 1:1 light petroleum (b.p. 40°-60° C.-ether containing an increasing proportion of triethylamine gave after a forerun of tamoxifen which was discarded, at 5% triethylamine, a mixture of  4-iodotamoxifen and its Z isomer:-	______________________________________	(i)   241 mg consisting of 3:1 trans (E):cis	(Z) isomers	(ii)  363 mg consisting of 1:1 trans (E):cis	as determined	(Z) isomers             by NMR	(iii) 406.5 mg consisting of 1:2 trans (E):cis	(Z) isomers	______________________________________	The total yield of products was 1.01 g (32%).	Recrystallisation of band (i) above gave a sample of the title compound, pure trans (E) isomer, m.p. 112°-114° C. (from light petroleum, b.p. 40°-60° C.). Found C, 62.88; H, 5.72; N, 2.79; I, 25.30%. C26H28INO requires C, 62.78; H, 5.67; N, 2.82; I, 25.51% NMR: δH (CDCl3, 250 MHz) 0.91 (3H, t J 7.4 Hz, CH3CH2), 2.28 (6 H, s, NMe2), 2.43 (2H, q, J 7.4 Hz, CH3CH2), 2.64 (2H, t, J 5.8 Hz, OCH2CH2N), 3.92 (2H, t, J 5.8 Hz, OCH2CH2N), 6.55 (2H, d, J 8.8 Hz, H-3,5 of C-C6H4 -0), 6.73 (2H, d, J 8.8 Hz, H- 2,6 of C-C6H4 -0), 6.98 (2H, d, J 8.3 Hz, H-2,6 of C-C6H4 -I), 7.04-7.22 (5H, m, Ph), 7.66 (2H, d, J 8.3 Hz, H-3,5 of C-C6H4 -I); mass spectrum m/z 497 (M+, 36%), 380(3), 72(100), 58(100).	The cis (Z) isomer gave δH (CDCl3, 60 MHz) inter alia 2.32 (6H, s, NMe2), 4.07 (2H, t, J 6 Hz, OCH2CH2N).	EXAMPLE 2	Preparation of E 1-[4-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]-1-(4-bromo phenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butene ("4-bromotamoxifen")	A stirred solution of 1,4-dibromobenzene (6.88 g, 29.15 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (30 ml) was cooled under nitrogen by a dry ice-acetone bath and n-butyllithium (15.1 ml of a 1.55M solution in hexane; 24 mmol) added over 2 minutes. A precipitate formed. After 10 minutes, a solution of 1-[4-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]-2-phenyl-1-butanone (6.09 g, 19.43 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (15 ml) was added and the mixture allowed to warm to room temperature.	After 16 hours, the mixture was worked up as described above for 4-iodotamoxifen to give crude tertiary alcohol as a solid, which was dissolved in ethanol (100 ml). Concentrated hydrochloric acid (60 ml) was added and the mixture heated up under reflux for 20 hours. Work up was as described above for 4-iodotamoxifen. The crude product was dissolved in hot light petroleum (b.p. 80°-100° C.) (40 ml). Cooling gave crystals of the title compound, i.e. the trans (E) isomer, (2.78 g, 32% yield). The mother liquors were applied to a column of silica (60 g). Elution with 20:20:1 light petroleum (b.p. 40°-60° C.)-ether-triethylamine gave	(i) 4.36 g oil consisting of 2.5:1 Z:E isomers	(ii) 0.58 g oil consisting of 4:1 Z:E isomers	The total yield was 7.72 g, 88%. The proportion of isomers in the crude product was estimated as 1.2:1.	Recrystallisation of (i) gave further trans (E) isomer, 0.19 g, then cis (Z) isomer, 1.10 g.	In a repeat of this reaction, but using a milder dehydration procedure (25 ml conc. HCl, 200 ml ethanol, reflux 30 minutes) the ratio of isomers in the crude product was improved to 1.6:1 but the yield was lower, 72% (35% yield of trans (E) isomer isolated following crystallisation).	The trans (E) isomer, 4-bromotamoxifen, had m.p. 114°-116° C. (from light petroleum, b.p. 80°-100° C.). Found C, 69.44; H, 6.29; N, 2.92; Br, 17.88. C26H28BrNO requires C, 69.32; H, 6.26; N, 3.11; Br, 17.74%; NMR: δH (CDCl3, 250 MHz) 0.91 (3H, t, J 7.4 Hz, CH3CH2), 2.28 (6H, s, NMe2), 2.44 (2H, q, J 7.4 Hz, CH3CH2), 2.64 (2H, t, J 5.7 Hz, OCH2CH2N), 3.92 (2H, t, J 5.7 Hz, OCH2CH2N), 6.56 (2H, d J 8.8 Hz, ArH ortho to OR), 6.73 (2H, d, J 8.8 Hz, ArH meta to OR), 7.08-7.26 (7H, m, ArH), 7.46  (2H, d, J 8.3 Hz, ArH ortho to Br).	The cis (Z) isomer had m.p. 77°-78° C. (from light petroleum, b.p. 80°-100° C.). Found C, 69.49; H, 6.31; N, 3.05; Br, 17.70. C26H28BrNO requires C, 69.33; H, 6.27; N, 3.11; Br, 17.74%; δH (CDCl3, 60 MHz), 0.90 (3H, t, J 7 Hz, CH3CH2), 2.31 (6H, s, NMe2), 2.48 (2H, q, J 7 Hz, CH3CH2), 2.71 (2H, t, J 6 Hz, OCH2CH2NMe2), 4.06 (2H, t, J 6 Hz, OCH2CH2NMe2), 6.62 (2H, d, J 9 Hz, ArH ortho to OR), 6.9-7.3 (11H, m, ArH).	EXAMPLE 3	Preparation of 4-iodotamoxifen via the (2-chloroethoxy)phenyl intermediate	1-[4-(2-chloroethoxy)phenyl]-2-phenyl-1-butanone has been prepared by R. McCague, J. Chem. Research, 1986, (S), 58-9; (M), 771-93, by Friedel-Crafts condensation of 2-phenylbutanoic acid and (2-chloroethoxy)benzene. 2-Phenylbutanoic acid is commercially available. (2-Chloroethoxy)benzene is obtainable by alkylation of phenol with 1,2-dichloroethane or by reaction of 2-phenoxyethanol with thionyl chloride.	A stirred solution of 1,4l -diiodobenzene (21.8 g, 66 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (100 ml) under nitrogen was cooled to ca.-75° C. and n-butyllithium (41.2 ml of a 1.6M solution in hexane, 66 mmol) introduced over 5 minutes. After 10 minutes, a solution of 1-[4-(2-chloroethoxy)phenyl]-2-phenyl-1-butanone (20.0 g, 66 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (40 ml) was added and the mixture allowed to warm to room temperature. After 20 hours, the mixture was partitioned between water (200 ml) and ether (200 ml). The ether solution was concentrated and the residual oil dissolved in ethanol (300 ml). Concentrated hydrochloric acid (100 ml) was added, the mixture heated under reflux for 4 hours, then cooled and poured into water (300 ml). The products were extracted with ether (2×150 ml), the combined extracts washed with water (200 ml), dried with sodium sulphate and concentrated to give a brown oil which was dissolvedin ethanol (200 ml). Crystals of mainly 1-[4-(2-chloroethoxy)phenyl]-1-(4-iodophenyl-2-phenyl-1-butene, i.e. the desired trans (E) isomer, of the (2-chloroethoxy)phenyl intermediate, were deposited, recrystallisation of which gave the pure isomer (12.92 g, 40%), m.p. 96°-97° C. Concentration of the original mother liquors gave the cis (Z) isomer (7.03 g, 22%), m.p. 110°-112° C.	Analysis of the crude oil by proton n.m.r. spectroscopy showed that it contained a 1.5:1 mixture of trans (E) and cis (Z) isomers.	A solution of E-1-[4-(2-chloroethoxy)phenyl]-1-(4-iodophenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butene (3.05 g) in 33% diethylamine in ethanol (60 ml) was boiled under reflux for 20 hours. The mixture was concentrated, a procedure made necessary only because of escape of the gaseous dimethylamine under these conditions, further 33% dimethylamine solution (60 ml) was added and reflux was continued for a further 20 hours. The mixture was again concentrated and the residue partitioned between ether (50 ml) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (1M; 50 ml). The ether solution was concentrated and the residue applied to a column of silica gel (Merck 15111, 40 g). Column chromatography was need to remove a small amount of unreacted starting material from the product which could not be removed by recrystallisation. This problem and the concentration step during addition of dimethylamine could have been overcome by carrying out the reaction in a sealed bomb. Elution with 5% methylamine in 1:1 ether-light petroleum (b.p. 40°-60° C.) gave 4-iodotamoxifen, which was further purified by recrystallisation from light petroleum (b.p. 40°-60° C.) (2.60 g, 84% yield), identical to that of Example 1.	EXAMPLE 4	Preparation of E-1-[4-(2-Diethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]-1-(4-iodophenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butene	The method of Example 3 was used, replacing the dimethylamine addition by a single portion of 1:1 diethylamine-ethanol (v/v) and refluxing for 2 days. 1.069 g of the (2-chloroethoxy)phenyl compound gave 1.03 g (93%) of the title compound, m.p. 58°-59° C. Found: C, 64.10; N, 6.21; N, 2.63; I, 24.12. C28H32INO requires C, 64.00; H, 6.14; N, 2.67; I, 24.15%.	EXAMPLE 5	Preparation of E-1-[4-(2-(N-pyrrolidino)ethoxy)phenyl]-1-(4-iodophenyl-2-phenyl-1-butene)	The chloroethoxy compound (1.748 g) prepared as in Example 3 and pyrrolidine (10 ml) in ethanol (30 ml) were heated under reflux for 2 hours. The mixture was then concentrated and partitioned between ether (30 ml) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (1M; 30 ml). The ether solution was concentrated and the title compound recrystallised from light petroleum (b.p. 80°-100° C.), yield 1.72 g, (92%), m.p. 108°-109° C. Found: C, 64.28; H, 5.83; N, 2.64; I, 24.06. C28H30INO requires C, 64.25; H, 5.78; N, 2.68; I, 24.24%. (Owing to greater reactivity of pyrrolidine than dimethylamine or diethylamine, all the starting material was consumed rapidly and chromatography was not required).	EXAMPLE 6	Preparation of E 1-[4-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]-1-(3-iodophenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butene ("3-iodotamoxifen")	A stirred solution of 1,3-diiodobenzene (5.45 g, 16.5 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (25 ml) at -78° C. under nitrogen was treated with a solution of n-butyl lithium in hexane (1.6M; 10.3 ml, 16.5 mmol). After 5 min, a solution of 1-[4-(2-chloroethoxy)-phenyl]-2-phenyl-1-butene (5.0 g, 16.5 mmol) in dry tetra-hydrofuran (15 ml) was added and the mixture allowed to warm to room temperature. After 20 h, the mixture was poured into water (100 ml) and the products extracted with ether (2×50 ml). The extracts were concentrated under vacuum and the residue dissolved in ethanol (80 ml). Concentrated hydrochloric acid (30 ml) was added and the mixture heated under reflux. After 4 h, the mixture was cooled and partitioned between water (100 ml) and ether (2×60 ml). The ether layers were dried with sodium sulphate, concentrated, and the residue chromatographed on silica gel (Merck 15111, 60 g). Elution with 1:20 l dichloromethane-light petroleum (b.p. 60°-80° C.) gave 1-[4-(chloroethoxy) phenyl]-1-(3-iodophenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butene as a ca. 1.5:1 mixture of E (trans) and Z (cis) isomers (determined by n.m.r. spectroscopy) and as an oil (6.46 g, 80% yield). This mixture (3.63 g) was dissolved in a solution of methylamine (30% w/v) in ethanol, and the resulting solution heated in a sealed vessel at 100° C. for 4 h, then cooled and concentrated to dryness. The residue was partitioned between aqueous sodium hydroxide (100 ml) and ether (100 ml). The ether solution was washed with water (50 ml), dried with sodium sulphate and the residual oil dissolved in cyclohexane (10 ml). Eventually 3-iodotamoxifen crystallised (1.51 g, 41%), m.p. 55°-57° C. NMR: δH (CDCl3, 250 MHz) 0.91 (3H, t, J 7.4 Hz, CH3CH2), 2.29 (3H, s, NMe2), 2.43 (2H, q, J 7.4 Hz, CH3CH2), 2.65 (2H, t, J 5.8 Hz, OCH2CH2N), 3.93 (2H, t, J 5.8. Hz, OCH2CH2N), 6.57 (2H, d, J 8.8 Hz, ArH ortho to side chain), 6.74 (2H, d, J 8.8 Hz, ArH meta to side chain), 7.05-7.26 (7H, m, ArH), 7.58- 7.63 (2H, m, ArH ortho to I).	EXAMPLE 7	Relative binding affinities (RBA) of 4-iodo and bromotamoxifen and also of tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen for comparison were determined by a rat uterine cytosol test, as follows. Immature rat uterine cytosol was incubated at 18° C. for 30 minutes with 5×10-9M (3H)estradiol in the absence and presence of increasing amounts (10-9 -10-5M) of the test compound or unlabelled estradiol (control). Unbound compounds were then removed with dextran-coated charcoal, and the amounts of estrogen receptor-bound (3H)estradiol were measured. The relative concentrations of estradiol and test compound required to achieve 50% inhibition of (3H)estradiol binding are the RBA: RBA=([I50 ](estradiol)/[I50 ](test compound×100.	A whole cell assay was then performed using the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line obtained from the Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit, USA. MCF-7 cells were maintained at 37° C. in monolayer culture in closed T-25 dishes in mininal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with L-glutamine (0.6 mg/ml), gentamycin (40 micrograms/ml). penicillin (100 U/ml) streptomycin (100 micrograms/ml) and 10% inactivated fetal calf serum (inactivated for 1 hour at 56° C.). The MCF-7 cells were incubated at 37° C. for 50 minutes with 10-9M (3H)estradiol in the absence or presence of increasing amounts (10-10 -10-5M) of the test compound or unlabelled estradiol (control). Bound compounds were then extracted with ethanol, and the amounts of estrogen receptor bound (3H) estradiol were measured. The RBA values were calculated as for the rat uterine cytosol.	The RBA values are shown below in Table 1.	______________________________________

In the whole cell test, on the other hand, the estrogen receptors are localised in the cell nucleus and therefore bound to DNA. In the whole cell test, a low value indicating poor binding to cell nucleus ER and consequently low estrogenicity, can be considered favorable.	EXAMPLE 8	MCF-7 cells were grown as described in Example 7 and incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours with the test compound at three different concentrations. The test compounds according to the invention used were 3- and 4- iodotamoxifen 4- bromotamoxifen and the analogues of 4-iodotamoxifen in which the dimethylamino group is replaced by diethylamino and pyrrolidino (Examples 4 and 5 respectively). For comparison Z isomers of two of these compounds and tamoxifen itself were tested. Figures in Table 2 below give the percentage cell growth compared with a "blank" sample, and standard deviations obtained from figures for four separate samples of culture. Values greater than 100 indicate a growth stimulating (estrogenic) effect.

The results indicate that the 4- iodo pyrrolidino derivative is particularly active, followed by the N,N-diethylamino derivative and the 4-iodo compound itself. The 3-iodo compound was about as active as tamoxifen in these tests, although the large deviation between individual results for this compound makes exact comparison difficult. The 4-bromo compound appeared less active than tamoxifen in these tests, in contrast to those of Example 7.	EXAMPLE 9	Following the procedure of Example 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,536,516 (ICI), 50 parts of 4l -iodotamoxifen, 42 parts of maize starch and 7 parts of alginic acid are intimately mixed and granulated using 10% maize starch paste as the granulating agent. The granules are dried at a temperature not exceeding 50° C., and then mixed with 1 part of magnesium stearate and compressed into tablets each weighing 50 mg. There are thus obtained tablets suitable for oral administration for therapeutic purposes.	EXAMPLE 10	Preparation of 4-iodotamoxifen from 4-bromotamoxifen	This Example shows that 4-bromotamoxifen is readily convertible into 4-iodotamoxifen. The Example was carried out using ordinary ("cold", non-radioisotopic) molecular iodine, for reasons of laboratory safety but could obviously be repeated substituting a radioisotopic iodine for ordinary iodine.	To a stirred solution of E-1-[4-[2-dimethylamino)ethoxy]-1-(4-bromophenyl)-2-phenyl-1-butene (146.5 mg, 0.325 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (1 ml) cooled to ca.-75° C. under an atmosphere of nitrogen was added a solution of tert-butyllithium in pentane (1.8M; 0.27 ml, 0.488 mmol). After 5 min, a solution of iodine (101.5 mg, 0.40 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (1 ml) was added and the mixture allowed to warm to room temperature, then diluted with water (5 ml) and extracted with ether (2×5 ml). The ether solution was dried with sodium sulphate and concentrated. The residual oil was virtually entirely 4-iodotamoxifen by NMR. The product was recrystallized from light petroleum, b.p. 60°-80° C. Yield 108.6 mg, 67%, m.p. 110° C. (previously recorded m.p. 112°-114° C.).	Note that half of the iodine is lost as iodide by the reaction Ar+I2 +ArI+I- (where Ar represents the residue of the tamoxifen molecule). In a radiolabelled synthesis it would be advisable to add first a portion less than an equivalent and I2 of radioisotopic iodine, then "cold" iodine to bring the reaction to completion.	EXAMPLE 11	Preparation of 125I 4-iodotamoxifen from non-radioisotopic 4-iodotamoxifen	8 mg of "cold" 4-iodotamoxifen were dissolved in 1:1 ethanol-ethyl acetate. To this solution was added 25 μl of a solution prepared by dissolution of 12 mg copper (II) sulphate in 500 μl methanol, and also 5 μl of a solution of sodium iodide-125 (ca.100 μl Ci) in dilute sodium hydroxide. This mixture was heated for 1 h at 106°-107° C. in a 2 ml sealed vessel ("Reacti-vial"). Thin layer chromatography on silica gel (eluant 1:1 v/v ethanol-ethyl acetate or 4:4:1 v/v/v petroleum ether-diethyl ether-triethylamine) indicated more than 99% exchange labelling.

Wegner & Bretschneider	The present invention relates to the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of Formula ##STR1## and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts with platelet aggregation inhibiting activity.	The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of this compound starting from the racemate and the pharmaceutical compositions containing it.	The present invention relates to the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of methyl alpha-5(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro(3,2-c)thieno pyridyl) (2-chlorophenyl)-acetate, a process for its preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing it.	The compound of the invention corresponds to the following formula (I): ##STR2## in which the C* is an asymmetric carbon atom. In fact, this formula represents both the dextro-rotatory molecule claimed as well as its levo-rotatory enantiomer. The racemic mixture corresponding to this formula was described in the French patent application published under the No. 2 530 247. Hereafter the dextro-rotatory enantiomer claimed according to the invention will be designated by Id and the levo-rotatory enantiomer by I1.	
US4847265_0002	It is known that the optical rotatory power of a compound depends on the solvent in which it is measured and on its concentration in this solvent. The optical rotatory power of the dextro-rotatory isomer according to the invention is positive in methanolic solution.	In an unexpected manner only the dextro-rotatory enantiomer Id exhibits a platelet aggregation inhibiting activity, the levo-rotatory enantiomer I1 being inactive. Moreover, the inactive levo-rotatory enantiomer I1 is the less well tolerated of the two enantiomers.	The invention also relates to the addition salts of the compounds of formula (Id) with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acids.	The compound (Id) is an oil whereas its hydrochloride exists as a white powder. The oily products are usually difficult to purify and it is preferable to use for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions crystalline products which can usually be purified by recrystallization.	However, it has been observed in the present case that some of the salts of compound (Id) usually precipitate in an amorphous form and/or that they are hygroscopic, a property which makes them difficult to handle on an industrial scale. Thus, the salts of carboxylic acid and sulfonic acids classically used in pharmacy have been prepared, acids such as acetic, benzoic, fumaric, maleic, citric, tartaric, gentisic, methane-sulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic and laurylsulfonic acids as well as the salts of dobesilic acid (m.p.=70° C.) and para-toluenesulfonic acid (m.p.=51° C.), the purification of which proved to be difficult.	Among the mineral and organic acid salts of the dextro-rotatory isomer of the compound of Formula (Id) salts have been found which crystallize easily, are not hygroscopic and are sufficiently water-soluble as to make their use as active medicinal principles particularly advantageous.	The present invention thus relates more particularly to the hydrogen sulfate, the taurocholate and the hydrobromide of the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of methyl alpha-5(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro(3,2-c)thieno pyridyl) (2-chlorophenyl)-acetate.	These salts are prepared in a standard manner by the action of the corresponding acid on the base in solution in a solvent from which they precipitate spontaneously or after addition of a non-solvent of the salt.	The dextro-rotatory isomer of methyl alpha-5(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro(3,2-c)thieno pyridyl) (2-chlorophenyl)-acetate can be prepared by forming the salt of the racemic compound with an optically active acid in a solvent, repeated recrystallizations of the salt until a product of constant optical rotatory power is obtained, followed by the liberation of the dextro-rotatory isomer from its salts by a base; if required, a salt is formed between the dextro-rotatory isomer and a pharmaceutically acceptable acid.	The optically active acid may advantageously be levo-rotatory camphor-10-sulfonic acid.	One and the same solvent may be used for salt formation and recrystallization: acetone is ideally suited in this case.	The chiral, levo-rotatory camphor-10-sulfonic acid of Formula (II1) is allowed to react in an inert solvent with the racemic mixture of Formula (I) according to the following reaction scheme: ##STR3## Salt formation may be carried out in solvents such as alcohols, ketones, dimethylformamide. The salt precipitates spontaneously or is isolated by salting out or evaporation of the solvent. A mixture of two diastereoisomers of Formula (IIIa) is formed. By repeated recrystallizations from a solvent such as acetone the precipitate is enriched in the salt of the dextro-rotatory isomer of compound (I). After each recrystallization the optical rotatory power [α]D20 of the precipitate is measured at 20° C. in methanol at a concentration varying between 1.5 and 2 g/100 ml. When the [α]D20 stops increasing the base of Formula (ID) is liberated from the salt (IIIa) by the action of a base such as sodium or potassium hydrogen carbonate in aqueous media at temperatures varying between 5° C. and 20° C. Evaporation of the filtrate of the first recrystallization IV after the crystals of the precipitated salt (IIIa) have been filtered off, gives a mixture enriched in the salt of (I1) enantiomer. The basification of this mixture of diastereoisomeric salts with a weak base such as sodium or potassium hydrogen carbonate in aqueous solution at temperatures varying between 5° C. and 20° C. leads to a mixture of the two enantiomers (Id) plus (I1) enriched in the levo-rotatory enantiomer (I1).	This mixture (Id)+(I1) enriched in enantiomer (I1) is allowed to react with dextro-rotatory camphor-10-sulfonic acid which will be designated as (IId) in a solvent according to the following reaction scheme: ##STR4## The crystalline mixture of diastereoisomeric salts (IIIb) obtained is recrystallized from acetone until the optical rotatory power [α]D20 of the precipitate remains constant. As previously mentioned the optical rotatory power [α]D20 of the diastereoisomeric salt (IIIb) is determined after each recrystallization.	The liberation of the stereoisomeric (I1) from its salt is carried out in a standard manner, like that for compound (Id). Levo-rotatory comphor-10-sulfonic acid (II1) may be obtained from commercially available ammonium camphor-10-sulfonate of Formula (V) according to the reaction scheme: ##STR5## An aqueous solution of the ammonium salt (V) is chromatographed on an Amberlite IRN-77 resin. After lyophilization of the eluate camphor-10-sulfonic acid of Formula (II1) is recovered.	The entire sequence of the process is shown schematically below: ##STR6##	Each of the pure enantiomers (Id) and (I1) may be converted into a salt by means of the standard methods: for example, the hydrochlorides are prepared by the addition of a solution of hydrogen chloride gas in diethyl ether to a solution of (Id) or (I1) in diethyl ether.	DETERMINATION OF THE ENANTIOMERIC PURITY OF THE DEXTRO-ROTATORY (Id) AND LEVO-ROTATORY (I1) ENANTIOMERS	Two methods have been used:	proton NMR spectroscopy with the addition of a chiral rare earth	high pressure liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase.	(a) Proton NMR spectroscopy with the addition of a chiral rare earth The enantiomeric purity (optical purity) was determined by 1H 60 MHz NMR spectroscopy in the presence of a rare earth chiral complex according to the method described by G. M. WHITESIDES et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974, 96, 1038).	In the racemic product (I), the hydrogen attached to the asymmetric centre in the α position to the ester function appears as a singlet (chemical shift δ=4.87 ppm in CDCl3 as solvent. The addition of the rare earth complex Eu(tfc)3 [tris 3-(trifluoromethyl hydroxymethylene)-d-camphorato europium (III)] to the probe containing a solution of the racemate (I) in CDCl3 leads to the resolution of the initial singlet into two, well-separated singlets corresponding to the proton of each of the two enantiomers (Id) and (I1). When the molar ratio of rare earth complex/compound (I)=0.4, the separation between the two singlets is about 6 Hz.	With each of the two enantiomers prepared, (Id) and (I1), the same procedure was used as for the racemate (I). The smaller chemical shift corresponds to the proton of the dextro-rotatory enantiomer (Id) and the larger chemical shift to the levo-rotatory enantiomer (I1).	The precision of the method was determined by comparing the 1H (60 MHz) NMR spectra obtained with and without addition of the rare earth complex for each of the two enantiomers (Id) and (I1) in the pure state or as mixtures containing increasing quantities of one of the enantiomers. It was observed that it was possible to detect easily more than 5% by weight of one enantiomer in the presence of the other.	(b) High pressure liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase The study was conducted with a liquid chromatograph HP-1084 using a UV detector at 215 nm. The chiral stationary phase was DEAE silica (10 microns) onto which was grafted alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (0.4×100 mm) (ENANTIOPAC R-LKB). The mobile phase consisted of an aqueous phosphate buffer mixture 8 mM (NaH2PO4 /Na2HPO4) containing 0.1M of NaCl, adjusted to pH=7.4, and 15% of isopropanol (v/v). The flow rate was fixed at 0.3 ml/minute and the temperature of the column was maintained at 18°-20° C. Under these conditions, the dextro-rotatory enantiomer (Id) has a retention time of 45 minutes and the levo-rotatory enantiomer (I1) has a retention time of 35 minutes.	The precision of the determination of the optical purity of the two enantiomers was estimated by chromatographing each of the two enantiomers (Id) and (I1) prepared either alone or as a mixture containing increasing amounts of one of the enantiomers. It was observed that it was easy to detect:	2% (weight/weight) of enantiomer (Id) in enantiomer (I1)	4% (weight/weight) of enantiomer (I1) in enantiomer (Id).	Under these conditions it may be concluded that the optical purity of the two enantiomers (Id) and (I1) obtained according to the examples is at least equal to 96% for the dextro-rotatory enantiomer (Id) and at least equal to 98% for the levo-rotatory enantiomer (I1).	The following examples are non-restrictive and are presented to illustrate the present invention.

PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY	The platelet aggregation inhibiting activity and the toxicity of these new compounds were compared to those of the racemic mixture described in the French Pat. No. 82.12599 (Publication No. 2 530 247).	A description will now be given of the results of this study which demonstrates another advantage of the invention, namely that the salts of the dextro-rotatory isomer have a better therapeutic index than the salt of the racemic mixture; in fact, the levo-rotatory isomer exhibits almost no platelet aggregation inhibiting activity and its toxicity is markedly higher than that of its dextro-rotatory homologue.	The platelet aggregation inhibiting activities and the antithrombotic activities of the compounds were studied in the rat by standard methods.	The activity on the aggregation of plates induced by ADP or collagen was determined ex-vivo.	The products dissolved in ethanol (200 mg/ml) and diluted in water containing gum arabic (5%-wt/v) were administered by the oral route to groups of five female rats of the CD-COBS strain, weighing 250-300 g, in amounts of 10 ml of suspension per kilogram two hours before blood samples were taken.	The blood samples were taken from animals anesthetized with diethyl ether by puncture of the abdominal aorta and placed over a 3.8% aqueous solution of sodium citrate (1 vol/9 volumes of blood). The platelet-rich plasma was then isolated by centrifugation at 200 g for 10 minutes.	Aggregation is induced by the addition of 2 μl of aggregating solution to 400 μl of platelet-rich plasma. The aggregating solutions used were: a 500 μM aqueous solution of ADP marketed by Boehringer Mannheim (final concentration 2.5 μM), and a solution of collagen marketed by Sigma (type 1) at a concentration of 0.25 g/100 ml in 3% acetic acid (v/v) (final concentration 12.5 μg/ml).	The aggregation of the platelets was monitored as described in the method by G. V. R. Born in Nature 194, p. 927 (1967) using a Coultronics® aggregometer at a temperature of 37° C. and agitation of 900 rpm.	For aggregation with ADP, the aggregometer generates a curve representing a platelet aggregation as measured by a change in optical density. The height of this curve is defined as the height of aggregation. The percentage of aggregation is the relation between the aggregation height measured and the height corresponding to 100% aggregation×100.

A metallic screw thread 21 mm long consisting of a dentist's drill, marketed by Dyna (France) size No. 30, was introduced into the lumen of this vein just below the renal bifurcation descending towards the iliac veins, without damaging the wall; 19 to 20 mm of the length of the screw thread are implanted and the remaining 1 mm protrudes through the closed stomach into the exterior.	The thrombi formed rapidly and five hours later, under pentobarbital anesthesia, the abdomen is reopened and ligatures are placed above and below the screw thread which is withdrawn after longitudinal incision of the vein and the isolated thrombus is weighed.

A method treating virus-induced and inflammatory diseases of skin and membranes in humans or animals, comprising application of a composition consisting of one or more of the aliphatic alcohols docosanol, tetracosanol and hexacosanol in a physiologically compatible carrier is disclosed.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION	This invention relates to alcohol-containing compositions which are useful in treating virus infections and inflammatory diseases of the skin and membranes, including burns, laceration damage and acute injuries. More specifically the present invention relates to a naarrow class of oaliphatic straightchain saturated monohydric alcohols which have from 20 to 26, preferably 22 to 26, carbons in the chain.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	It is well-known that certain selected alcohols have some physiological activity. It is known, for example, that 1-triacontanol stimulates the growth of plants, see, e.g. Ries, Stanley K. and Sweeney, Charles C., U.S. Pat. No. 4,150,970. Interestingly, the C-30 aalcohol triacontanol appears to possess this physiologicl activity and that the C-28 and C-32 do not possess such physiological activity, or at least have very much less physiological activity in plant growth, see, e.g., the patents and publications of Ries et al., ibid, and of Ashmead, Harvey H., Weleber, Andrew J., Laughlin, Robert G., Nickey, Donald O. & Parker, Dane. K, and Ohorogge, Alvin J.	Triacontanol has also been reported to accelerate the decomposition of sewage and reduce H.S, Starr, Jerry, U.S. Pat. No. 4,246,100.	Beeswax comprises, inter alia, esters of long-chain aliphatic alcohols having chain lengths in the area of interest, and it is known to obtain such alcohols by hydrolysis of beeswax. Beeswax has been used sicne antiquity in a great variety of cosmetic and thereapeutic applications, as a bse for lipstick, in lotions and creams, as an emollient and as a constituent in therapeutic products for topical and membrane application. Various constituents of beeswax and products derived from beeswax have also been used in cosmetic and therapeutic applications. For example, Slimak, Karen M., U.S. Pat. No. 4,793,991, describes a hypoallerginic cosmetic comprising single plant source beeswax. Gans, Eugen, Nacht, Sergio and Yeung, David have described the use of the non-polar saturated straight chain C-21 to C-33 hydrocarbon fraction of beeswax in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders, U.S. Pat. No. 4,623,667.	The mechanism of the rather diverse and upredictable physiological effects of the vaarious alcohols are, at best, poorly understood and studies are not generally definitive. There appears to some interaction of certain nalkanols with lipid bilayer membranes, Westerman, PW, Pope, JM, Phonphok, N., Dan, JW, dubro, DW, Biochim Biophys Acta (NETHERLANDS) 939, 64-78 (1988), and studies have been conducted respecting the partitioning of long-chain alcohols into lipid bilayers, Franks NP & Lieb WR, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83 5116-20 (1986); cholesterol solubility of n-alkanols, Pal S. & Moulik SP, Indian J Biochem Biophys 24 24-8 (1987); neurological effects of certain long-chain alcohols, Natarajan V & Schmid HH, Lipids 12 128-30 (1977); Snider SR, Ann Neurol 16 723 (1984); Borg J, Toazara J. Hietter H, Henry M, Schmitt G, Luu B, FEBS Lett 213 406-10 (1987).	Levin, Ezra reported that tetracosanol, hexacosanol, octacosanol and triacontanol aand their esters improved physical performance of athletes and disclosed compositions comprising such alcohols and esters in vegetable oil bases for oral ingestion, U.S. Pat. No. 3,031,376.	An incidental disclosure of a composition intended for topical application comprising a major portion liquified gaseous propellant and a minor portion of a mixiture of C-12 to C-30 fatty alcohols which were used simply to mark the areas of application of the aerosol is contained in U.S. Pat. No. 3,584,115 to Gebhart.	Clark, U.S. Pat. No. 4,670,471 discloses the use of triacontanol, in a suitable carrier, as a treatment for inflammatory disorders such as herpes simplex, eczema, shingles, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, etc. Clark performed experiments with the compositions of the type disclosed by Gebhart, U.S. Pat. No. 3,584,115 comprising an aerosol and a mixture of triacontanol and palmitic acid, which Clark indicates to be as effective as pure triacontanol, and concluded that the aerosol carrier destroyed the effect of triacontanol and that a hydrophilic carrier for triacontanol was necessary to achieve the desired anti-inflammatory effect. There is some reason to believe that Clark's composition was simply saponified beeswax which would contain triacontanol and palmitic acid, as Clark indicates, but which would also contain, as substantial constituents, hexacosanolic acid nd various hydrocarbons. Results of gas chromatographic-mass spectrum analysis of various compositions believed to have been used by Clark were not definitive, but suggested that at least some such compositions were very complex mixtures, some of which may be lower alkanes, esters, acids or alcohols. Whether or not these were found by Clark to be effective anti-inflammatory compositions is not known. McKeough, Mark & Spruance, SL evaluated the efficacy of 5 percent triacontanol in a branch chain ester base in the treatment of HSV-1 dorsal cutaneous infection in guinea pigs and concluded that the active ingredient in triacontanol is the long chain hydrocarbon (unpublished report in the file of U.S. Pat. No. 4,670,471).	Revici, Emanuel, Sherwood, Bob E., Benecke, Herman P., Rice, John M., and Geisler, Richard W., U.S. Pat. No. 4,513,008, disclose a method of inactivating developed virus using C-20 to C-24 polyunsaturated acids, aldehydes or alcohols having 5-7 double bonds, and references disclosures by Sands et al. (Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 15, 67-73 (1979)), antiviral acivity of C-14 to C-20 unsaturated alcohols having 1-4 double bonds, C-20 tetraenyl alcohol having low activity, Snipes et al., (Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 11, 98-104 (1977) and Symp. Pharm. Effects Lipids (AOCS Monograph No. 5) 63-74 (1978) even lower antiviral activity for saturated long-chain alcohols.	Katz, Martin & Neiman, Herbert M, U.S. Pat. No. 3,592,930 disclose a medicant vehicle containing from 15 to 45 parts of saturated fatty alcohol from 16 to 24 carbons, along with glycol solvent, plasticizer, penetrant and adjuvant which is used as a carrier for oantibiotics, steriods, antihistamines, etc.	Ryde, Emma Marta & Ekstedt, Jan Erik, U.S. Pat. No. 3,863,633 disclose a composition for topical treatament of the eye which comprises a lipophilic substance, a hydrophilic swellable polymer and from 10 to 80 percent C-12 to C-22 surface active alcohols such as 1-docossanol, 1-hexadecanol, 1-octadecanol and 1-eicosanol which serve as a stabilizer for the mixture.	The content of othe prior art and the corresponding skill of the art, relative to topically administered compositions, may be summarized as follows: Short-chain alcohols, i.e. under about 16 carbons, tend to be irritants while longer chain alcohols, particularly the aliphatic alcohols tend to be non-irritating (Katz et al., supra). 1-Triacontanol, a 30-carbon unsaturated aliphatic alcohol, in a suitable hydrophilic carrier has (or may have depending upon the precise compositions used by Clark) value in treating inflammatory conditions of the skin (Clark, supra). Shorter chain C-10 to C-14 aliphatic alcohols demonstrate low level in vitro virucidal characteristics, while C-18 alcohols show noo discernable virucidal activity in vitro (Snipes, supra). Polyunsaturated C-20 to C-24 alcohols inactive enveloped virus (Revici et al., supra). C-16 to C-24 aliphatic alcohols are useful as stabilizers in carrier compositions for drugs having diverse physiological activity.	Respecting aliphatic alcohols, one would predict from the studies of Snipes and Clark that, in the continuum of aliphatic alcohols from C-10 to C-30 virucidal activity, at a very low level, may appear (if in vitro studies may be used to predict in vivo results) in C-10 to C-14 alcohols (which would also be irritants as reported by Katz), that virucidal activity disappears inthe C-16 to C-28 range and than appears uniquely (if Clark's compositions were pure triacontanol or mixtures of triacontanol with palmitic acid as he indicates) with the C-30 alcohol 1-triacontanol, which has been shown to have unique physiological effects in plant treatment.	Even considering the possible ambiguity of Clark's compositions, one would not predict any significant virucidal activity for aliphatic alcohols in the C-20 through C-28 chain-length.	Notwithstanding the negative teachings of the prior art, the present invention comprises compositions and methods for topical treatment of inflammatory diseases, including virus-induced inflammation, burns, laceration damage and acute injuries, in which the active constitute consists essentially of C-20 to C-26, and preferably C-22 to C-26 aliphatic alcohols, e.g. docosanol, tetraccosanol and hexacosanol.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	The present invention is embodied in a method treating inflammatory and viral skin diseases, such as may result, for example, from virus infection, burns, lacerations and acute injuries, comprising application of a composition consisting of one or more of C-20 to C-26 aliphatic alcohols, preferably one or more alcohols selected from the group consisting of 1-docosanol, 1-tetracosanol and 1-hexacosanol in a physiologically compatible carrier.	DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS	The compositions suitable for use in this invention consists essentially of a carrier which is physiologically compatible with the skin and membrane tissues of the patient, i.e. non-irritating, and which is substantially inactive physiologically (except for possible emollient properties) and, as the physiologically active composition, one or more C-20 to C-26 aliphatic alcohols, e.g. one or more of 1-eiconol, 1-docosanol, 1-tetracosanol and 1-hexacosanol.	The method may be carried out using compositions inwhich the sole physiologically active agent(s) is the C-20 to C-26 aliphatic alcohol, or comparable compositions which may also include other physiologically active constituents which do not interfere with the efficacy of the C-20 to C-26 alcohols.	The composition of the carrier is not critical so long as the carrier is non-irritating to skin and membranes and is substanatially free from physiological effect, e.g. has no physiological effect other than be an emollient.	An exemplary composition for use in this invention would be similar to that disclosed by Katz, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3,592,930 without the addition of any other physiologically active constituent, e.g. a mixiture of C-20 to C-26 alcohols, preferably one or more of the alcohols 1-docosanol, 1-tetracosanol and 1-hexacosanol, a glycol solvent such as propylene glycol, and, if desired, a plasaticizer such as glycerol or a polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of from 800 to 20,000.	
US4874794_0002	A suitable carrier may comprise white petrolatum, stearyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, sorbitan monooleate, propylelne glycol, water and a detergent such as polyoxyl stearate mixed for form a stable cream. The active alcohols, e.g. one or more of 1-docosanol, 1-tetracosanol and 1-hexacosanol is added to the carrier in amounts from about 0.1 to about 25 percent by weight, typically in the range of from 1 to 5 percent. Higher concentrations of the active alcohol(s) may be used but no increase in efficacy results from concentrations above about 15 to 25 weight percent. The concentration of the active alcohol(s) is not critical, but optimum efficacy coupled with efficient use of the active ingredient would be found in the 1 to 5 weight percent range.	Another suitable composition for use in the method of this invention would be a cream formulated of water, white petrolatm, isopropyl myristate, lanolin alcohols, mineral oil and cetylstearyl alcohol into which from 1 to 5 percent of C-20 to C-26 alcohols, e.g. one or more alcohols selected from the group consisting of 1-docosanol, 1-tetracosanol and 1-hexacosanol has been intimately mixed.	An alternative suitable composition for use in this invention may be formulated of stearyl alcohol, petrolatum, water and mineral oil stabilized with a detergent such as sodium lauryl sulfate and may include a preservative such as methylparaben or propylparaben, and an effective amount, typically from about 0.1 to 5 percent by weight of one or more alcohols selected from the group consisting of 1-docosanol, 1-tetracosanol and 1-hexacosanol.	In all cases, suitale preservatives, such as ethylene diamine tetraacetate salts, methylparaben, propylparaben, etc., may be added to prevent bacterial and fungal growth.

This invention relates to (substituted-aralkyl)heterocyclic compounds, and in particular relates to such compounds which are useful as inhibitors of the enzyme aromatase.	Aromatase is an enzyme which effects aromatisation of ring A in the metabolic formation of various steroid hormones. Various cancers, for example breast cancer, are dependent upon circulating steroid hormones which have an aromatic ring A. Such cancers can be treated by removing the source of ring A aromatised steroid hormones, for example by the combination of oophorectomy and adrenalectomy. An alternative way of obtaining the same effect is by administering a chemical compound which inhibits the aromatisation of the steroid ring A, and the compounds of the invention are useful for this purpose.	A variety of compounds possessing aromatase inhibitory activity is known, of which the most important clinically is aminoglutethimide. Aminoglutethimide, however, has the drawback that it affects other aspects of steroid metabolism, with the consequence that its use is often associated with undesirable side-effects. It is a particular object of the present invention to provide aromatase inhibitory compounds with fewer undesirable side effects than aminoglutethimide.

For example, methyl 3,5-dimethylbenzoate VIII was brominated with N bromosuccinimide to form the 3,5-bis(bromomethyl) compound IX, which was converted as described above to the corresponding dinitrile X and alkylated dinitrile XI. This compound XI was then reduced, for example with lithium borohydride, to the corresponding alcohol XII, which was then converted either to the starting material of the formula II in which X is chlorine by reaction with thionyl chloride or phosphoryl chloride, or to a starting material of the formula II in which X is an alkylsulphonyloxy or arylsulphonyloxy radical by reaction with an appropriate alkylsulphonyl chloride or arylsulphonyl chloride, for example mesyl chloride or tosyl chloride.

The epoxide may be isolated as such, and then reacted with a heterocyclic compound R6H, or the epoxide may be formed in situ by reacting the aldehyde of the formula III, trimethylsulphoxonium iodide and the heterocyclic compound R6H together in one reaction.

In optional process (xiii), the dehydrohalogenation reaction may be carried out with a base, for example, sodium triazole, a sodium (lower alkoxide) or sodium hydroxide.	In optional process (xiv), a suitable reducing agent is, for example, sodium borohydride.	In optional process (xv), a suitable trialkylsilane is, for example, triethylsilane, in trifluoroacetic acid.	In optional process (xvi), a suitable halogen substituent is, for example, a bromine atom, and a suitable metal cyanide is, for example, cuprous cyanide.	The processes (a) to (d) of the invention, and optional subsequent processes (i) to (xiii) may be carried out as specified, and may be accelerated or completed by heating.	As indicated above, the compounds of the invention of the formula I are useful as aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase inhibition may be demonstrated by the following tests:	DEMONSTRATION OF ACTIVITY IN VITRO	Aromatase inhibitory activity was measured using the enzyme present in the microsomal fraction of human term placenta, as described by Ryan, J. Biol, Chem. 234,268, 1959. Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the amount of tritiated water released from 0.5 micromolar (1β,2β-3H)testosterone after 20 minutes incubation at 37°. The method used was essentially that described by Thomson and Siiteri, J. Biol. Chem. 249,5364,1974 except that testosterone was used in place of androstenedione Test compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) then diluted as appropriate to achieve final concentrations of 2, 0.2 or 0.02 μg/ml. The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μl of microsome suspension to 50 μl of a solution containing substrate (testosterone) and cofactors (NADPH glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and either DMSO alone or a DMSO solution of test compound Each concentration of test compound was tested in triplicate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of 5% (w/v) suspension of charcoal in 0.5% (w/v) solution of Dextran T70 in water. After 1 hour the charcoal was precipitated by centrifugation and 150 μl of supernatant removed and the amount of tritiated water present determined using a liquid scintillation counter. The number of counts in supernatant from incubations containing test compound expressed as a percentage of the counts in supernatant from incubations containing only DMSO was taken as the degree of enzyme inhibition achieved by the test compound	DEMONSTRATION OF ACTIVITY IN VIVO	Activity in vivo was demonstrated in terms of ovulation inhibition in female rats. Daily vaginal smears were taken from rats housed under controlled lighting (lights on 06.00 hr to 20.00 hr) and those having a vaginal smear pattern consistent with 4 day ovarian cycles were selected To these rats a single dose of test compound was given either at 16.00 hr on Day 2 of the cycle or at 12.00 hr on Day 3 of the cycle. The rats were then killed in the morning following Day 4 of the cycle--approximately 64 hours after Day 2 treatments or approximately 46 hours after Day 3 treatments--and the presence or absence of eggs in the fallopian tubes determined. The presence of eggs indicates that the rats have ovulated.	Without treatment more than 95% of rats with 4-day ovarian cycles are found to have ovulated at the time of the post-mortem examination. At an effective dose, aromatase inhibitors prevent ovulation i.e. no eggs are found in the fallopian tubes.	
US4935437_0004	In the above tests, the compounds of formula I are active at less than 10 μg/ml (in vitro), and the preferred compounds of the formula I are active at below 0.1 μg/ml (in vitro) and 1.0 mg/kg (in vivo), and no indication of any toxicity has been seen at these doses.	Thus, according to a further feature of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition which comprises an effective amount of a compound of the formula I together with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable diluent or carrier.

The moiety Rb may be converted to the moiety Ra by any suitable means, for example when Rb represents a hydroxyl group and Ra represents RIHN(CH2)n--O-- the appropriate conversion may be carried out by coupling a compound of formula (VA): ##STR10## wherein R2, R3 and A2 are as defined in relation to formula (I) and Rz is hydrogen or a nitrogen protecting group, with a compound of formula (VI):	R1NRx (CH2)n --OH                     (VI)	wherein R1 and n are as defined in relation to formula (I) and Rx is hydrogen or a nitrogen protecting group, in the presence of a suitable coupling agent; and thereafter, if required, carrying out one or more of the following optional steps:	(i) reducing a compound of formula (III) wherein R2 and R3 together represent a bond, to a compound of formula (III) wherein R2 and R3 each represent hydrogen;	(ii) removing any nitrogen protecting group.	A suitable coupling agent for the coupling reaction between the compound of formula (VA) and (VI) is provided by diethylazodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphine. The coupling reaction may be carried out in any suitable solvent at a low to medium temperature, for example in tetrahydrofuran at a temperature in the range of between 0° and 60° C.	One example of the preparation of a compound of formula (VA) is that wherein a compound falling within formula	(v) of particular formula (VII): ##STR11## wherein A2 is as defined in relation to formula (I), and R11 represents a hydroxyl group or a protected hydroxyl group, is reacted with 2,4-thiazolidinedione; and thereafter if required removing any protecting group.	Preferably, R11 represents a benzyloxy group.	Suitable conditions for the reaction between a compound of formula (VII) and 2,4-thiazolidinedione are those defined above in relation to the reaction between the compounds of formula (V) and 2,4-thiazolidinedione.	The compounds of formula (IV), (VI) and (VII) are either known compounds or are prepared using methods analogous to those used to prepare known compounds.	Suitable protecting groups in any of the abovementioned reactions are those used conventionally in the art. Thus, for example, a suitable nitrogen protecting group is a benzyl group or a benzyloxycarbonyl group and a suitable hydroxyl protecting group is a benzyl group.	The methods of formation and removal of such protecting groups are those conventional methods appropriate to the molecule being protected. Thus for example when R11 represents a benzyloxy group such group may be prepared by treatment of the appropriate compound of formula (VII), wherein R11 is a hydroxyl group with a benzyl halide, such as benzyl bromide, and thereafter when required the benzyl group may be conveniently removed using a mild ether cleavage reagent such as trimethylsilyliodide.

Suitable values for Ra include those described above in relation to the compound of formula (III). Thus Ra may represent R1HN-(CH2)n--O--, as defined above, and hence the appropriate compound of formula (IX) may be reacted with a reagent of the abovedefined formula (IV) to provide the required compound of formula (VIII).	Suitable reaction conditions for the reaction of the compound of formula (IX) and the appropriate reagent may include those described above in relation to the preparation of compound (III) with the said appropriate reagent.

The compound of formula (XA) may be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula (X) by reaction with either a tosyl halide or a mesyl halide in a solvent such as pyridine.	The compounds of formula (IX) are known compounds or compounds prepared by methods analogous to those used to prepare known compounds, for example 4-fluorobenzaldehyde and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde are known commercially available compounds.	The reagent of formula (X) may be prepared by reacting a compound of the hereinabove defined formula (IV), with a compound of the hereinbefore defined formula (VI) and thereafter if required removing any nitrogen protecting group using the appropriate conventional conditions.	The reaction between the compounds of formula (IV) and (VI) may be carried out under any suitable conditions, such as in solvent, for example in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, at a low to medium temperature, for example a temperature in the range of from 0° to 60° C.	Favourably when R1 represents hydrogen the reaction is carried out using the compound of formula (VI) as a solvent at a low to elevated temperature, suitably an elevated temperature such as in the range of between 100° and 170° C.

The conversion of a compound of formula (I) to a further compound of formula (I) may be carried out by using any appropriate conventional procedure.	A suitable reduction method for the abovementioned conversion (a) includes catalytic reduction or the use of a metal/solvent reducing system.	Suitable catalysts for use in the catalytic reduction are palladium on carbon catalysts, preferably a 10% palladium on charcoal catalyst; the reduction being carried out in a solvent, for example dioxan, suitably at ambient temperature.	Suitable metal/solvent reducing systems include magnesium in methanol.	The abovementioned reduction of a compound of formula (III) wherein R2 and R3 together represent a bond to a compound of formula (III) wherein R2 and R3 each represent hydrogen, may be carried out under analogous conditions to those referred to above in conversion (a) of the compound of formula (I).	In the abovementioned conversion (b), suitable conversions of one group R1 into another group R1 includes converting a group R1 which represents hydrogen into a group R1 which represents an acyl group.	The conversion of a compound of formula (I) wherein R1 represents hydrogen into a compound of formula (I) wherein R1 represents acyl may be carried out using any appropriate conventional acylation procedure, such as by treating an appropriately protected compound of formula (I) with an acylating agent. For example acetic anhydride may be used to prepare the compound of formula (I) wherein R1 is acetyl.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION	The present invention relates to novel carbostyril derivatives. More particularly, the invention relates to novel carbostyril derivatives and salts thereof, processes for preparing said carbostyril derivatives and salts thereof, as well as pharmaceutical compositions for treating schizophrenia containing, as the active ingredient, said carbostyril derivative or salt thereof.	
US5006528_0002	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	Schizophrenia is the most common type of psychosis caused by an excessive neurotransmission activity of the dopaminergic nervous system in the central nervous system. [Cf. "Hypothesis of Excessive Dopamine" by Michio Tohru: TAISHA (Metabol:sm), Vol. 22, pp. 49, (1985); and Pharmacia Review, No. 10, "KOKORO-TO-KUSURI (Mind and Drugs)" edited by Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.]	Heretofore, a number of drugs, having the activity for blocking the neurotransmission of dopaminergic receptor in the central nervous system, have been developed, the example for said drugs are phenothiazine-type compounds such as Chlorpromazine; butyrophenone-type compounds such as Haloperidol; and benzamide-type compounds such as Sulpiride. These known drugs are now used widely for the purpose of improving so-called positive symptoms in the acute period of schizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions and excitations and the like.	However, many of these drugs are considered as not effective for improving so-called the negative symptoms which are observed in the chronic period of schizophrenia such as apathy, emotional depression, hypopsychosis and the like. In addition to the above, these drugs give important side-effects such as akathisia, dystonia, Parkinsonism dyskinesia and late dyskinesia and the like, which are caused by blocking the neurotransmission of dopaminergic receptor in the striate body. Furthermore, other side-effects such as hyperprolactinemia and the like given by these drugs are become other problems. [Cf. G. M. Simpson, E. H. Pi, and J. J. Sramek, Jr.: Drugs, Vol. 21, pp. 138 (1981).]	Under these circumstances, development of drugs for treating schizophrenia having safety and clinically effectiveness have been eagerly expected.	The present inventors have made an extensive study for the purpose of developing drugs for treating schizophrenia, which would be not only effective for improving the negative symptoms, but also effective for improving the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, furthermore such drugs would have less side-effects as compared with those shown by drugs known in prior art. As the result, the present inventors have successfully found carbostyril derivatives having strong activity for blocking neurotransmission of dopaminergic receptor. As to the side-effects given by known drugs for treating schizophrenia are for example, in the case of phenothiazine-type drugs, the orthostatic hypotension and hypersedation on the basis of strong α-blocking activity; and in the case of drugs having strong activity for blocking neurotransmission of dopaminergic receptor, the side-effects are so-called extrapyramidal tract syndromes such as catalepsy, akathisia, dystonia and the like caused by the blocking neurotransmission of dopaminergic receptor in the atriate body.	Among carbostyril derivatives known in prior art, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,734,416; Canadian Patent No. 1,117,110; British Patent No. 2,017,701; German Patent Nos. 2,911,108, 1,912,105 and 2,953,723; Japanese Patent Kokai (Laid-open) Nos. 54-130,587 (1979), 55-127,371, (1980) and 62-149,664 (1987) are having chemical structural formulas of upper conception of carbostyril derivatives of the present invention.	Furthermore, carbostyril derivatives disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,234,585 and European Patent No. 226,441 have chemical structural formula similar to that of carbostyril derivatives of the present invention, but the pharmacological activities thereof are different from those of possessed by the carbostyril derivatives of the present invention.	In addition to the above, the carbostyril derivatives disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,234,584 have chemical structural formula similar to that of carbostyril derivatives of the present invention and also have pharmacological activities similar to those of shown by carbostyril derivatives of the present invention.	Carbostyril derivatives disclosed in Australian Patent No. 50252/85, Japanese Patent Kokai (Laid-open) Nos. 58-43952 (1983), 56-49359 (1981), 56-49360 (1981) and 56-49361 (1981) have substituents different from those of the carbostyril derivatives of the present invention.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	It is an object of the present invention to provide novel carbostyril derivatives and salts thereof.	A further object of the present invention is to provide processes for preparing said carbostyril derivatives and salts thereof.	A still further object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for treating schizophrenia.	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS	Carbostyril derivatives of the present invention and salts thereof are represented by the general formula (1) as follows: ##STR5## (wherein R is a group of the formula ##STR6## (wherein R1 is a C1 -C3 alkoxy group)), a group of the formula ##STR7## wherein R2 and R3 are each, at the same time, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom; and R4 is a hydrogen atom or a chlorine atom, 2-methyl-3-nitrophenyl group, 3,5-dichlorophenyl group, or a group of the formula ##STR8## wherein R5 is a chlorine atom or a bromine atom; and R6 is a methyl group ; the carbon-carbon bond between 3- and 4-positions in the carbostyril skeleton is a single or double bond), and salts thereof.	Carbostyril derivatives and salts thereof represented by the general formula (1) possess strong activity for blocking the neurotransmission effect of dopaminergic receptor, with a weak α-blocking activity which have been found during the step of research and development of a number of carbostyril derivatives, thus when the strength of α-blocking activity of a carbostyril derivative is defined as the dose (ED50, mg/kg, per os) which is required to inhibits 50% of deth of mice being administered with epinephrine, and also the strength of activity for blocking the neurothransmission effect of dopaminergic receptor which is the main activity of carbostyril derivative, is defined as the dose (ED50, mg/kg, per os) which is required to inhibits 50% of stereotypy of mice induced by administration with apomorphine, the agonist of dopamine.

The compounds are potent and selective antagonists of the effect of 5-HT at 5-HT3 receptors and are useful, for example, in the treatment of psychotic disorders, anxiety, and nausea and vomiting.	This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/602,771, filed Oct. 24, 1990, abandoned which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/239,626, filed Sep. 2, 1988, now abandoned.	This invention relates to lactam derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their medical use.	In particular the invention relates to compounds which are potent and selective antagonists of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) at 5-HT receptors of the type located on terminals of primary afferent nerves.

The potent and selective antagonism of 5HT at 5-HT3 receptors by compounds of the invention has been demonstrated by their ability to inhibit 3-(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4yl)-1-[1-(methyl-t3)-1H-indol-3yl]-1-propanone binding in rat entorhinal cortex homogenates (following the general procedure described by G. Kilpatrick et al. in Nature, 1987, 330, 746), and/or by their ability to inhibit the 5-HT-induced depolarisation of the rate isolated vagus nerve preparation.	In addition to their activity as potent and selective antagonists of 5-HT at 5-HT3 receptors, certain compounds according to the invention have the advantage of an extended duration of action.	a particularly preferred compound on account of both its potency and duration of action is 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-5-methyl-2-[(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indol-1-one and its physiologically acceptable salts and solvates. Preferred salts of this compound are the hydrochloride and maleate.	Compounds of formula (I), which antagonise the effect of 5-HT at 5-HT3 receptors, are useful in the treatment of conditions such as psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia and mania); anxiety; and nausea and vomiting, particularly that associated with cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Compounds of formula (I) are also useful in the treatment of gastric stasis; symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction such as occur with dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, reflux oesophagitis, flatulence and irritable bowel syndrome; migraine; and pain. Compounds of formula (I) may also be used in the treatment of dependency on drugs and substances of abuse, depression, and dementia and other cognitive disorders.	According to another aspect, the invention provides a method of treatment of a human or animal subject suffering from a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or mania; or from anxiety; nausea or vomiting; gastric stasis; symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction such as dyspepsia, reflux oesophagitis, peptic ulcer, flatulence and irritable bowel syndrome; migraine; or pain, which comprises administering an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.	Accordingly, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises at least one compound selected from compounds of the general formula (I), and their physiologically acceptable salts and solvates (e.g. hydrates), for use in human or veterinary medicine, and formulated for administration by any convenient route.	Such compositions may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.	Thus the compounds according to the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, parenteral or rectal administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or nose).	For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxylpropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycollate); or wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparation for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g. almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavouring, colouring and sweetening agents as appropriate.	Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound.	For buccal administration the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.	The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterily pyrogen-free water, before use.	The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.	In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds of the invention may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds of the invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example as a sparingly soluble salt.	For administration by inhalation the compounds according to the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurised packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurised aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.	For intra nasal administration, the compounds according to the invention may be formulated as solutions for administration via a suitable metered or unit dose device or alternatively as a powder mix with a suitable carrier for administration using a suitable delivery device.	The compounds of formula (I) may also be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents. Thus, for example, in the treatment of gastric stasis, symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction and nausea and vomiting, the compounds of formula (I) may be administered in combination with antisecretory agents such as histamine H2 -receptor antagonists (e.g. ranitidine, sufotidine, 1-methyl-5-[[3-[3-(1-piperidinylmethyl)phenoxy]propyl]amino]-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-methanol, cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine or roxatidine) or H+K+ATPase inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole).	A proposed dose of the compounds of the invention for administration to man (of approximately 70 kg body weight) is 0.001 to 100 mg, preferably 0.01 to 50 mg, more preferably 0.1 to 20 mg of the active ingredient per unit dose expressed as the weight of free base, which could be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per day. It will be appreciated that it may be necessary to make routine variations to the dosage, depending on the age and condition of the patient. The dosage will also depend on the route of administration.	Compounds of general formula (I) and physiologically acceptable salts or solvates thereof may be prepared by the general methods outlined hereinafter. In the following description, the groups R1, n, and Im are as defined for compounds of general formula (I) unless otherwise stated.	According to a first general process (A), a compound of general formula (I) may be prepared by alkylating a compound of formula (II): ##STR6##	with a compound of formula (III):	LCH2 -Im                                              (III)	or a protected derivative thereof, wherein L represents a leaving atom or group, such as a halogen atom (e.g. chlorine, bromine or iodine), or an acyloxy group (e.g. trifluoroacetyloxy or acetoxy), or a sulphonyloxy group (e.g. trifluoromethanesulphonyloxy, p-toluenesulphonyloxy or methanesulphonyloxy), followed wherein necessary by removal of any protecting groups. L is preferably a halogen atom (e.g. a chlorine atom).	The reaction may be carried out in an inert solvent such as an ether (e.g. dimethoxyethane, diglyme or tetrahydrofuran), a substituted amide (e.g. dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone), an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. toluene), a ketone (e.g. acetone), or dimethyl sulphoxide, at a temperature between ambient and 100° C., in the presence of a base. Suitable bases include alkali metal hydrides (e.g. sodium hydride), alkali metal carbonates (e.g. sodium carbonate), alkali metal amides (e.g. sodium amide), alkali metal alkoxides (e.g. potassium t-butoxide) or alkali metal hydroxides (e.g. sodium or potassium hydroxide).	According to another general process (B), a compound of general formula (I) wherein n represents 2, may be prepared by hydrogenation of a compound of formula (IV): ##STR7## or a protected derivative thereof, followed where necessary by removal of any protecting groups.	Hydrogenation according to general process (B) may be effected using conventional procedures, for example using hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst (e.g. palladium, Raney nickel, platinum or rhodium). The catalyst may be supported on, for example, charcoal or alumina, or alternatively a homogeneous catalyst such as tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium chloride may be used. The hydrogenation will generally be effected in a solvent such as an alcohol (e.g. methanol or ethanol), an ether (e.g. dioxan), or an ester (e.g. ethyl acetate), or in a mixture of an alcohol and either a hydrocarbon (e.g. toluene) or a halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethan), at a temperature in the range -20° to +100° C., and at a pressure of from 1 to 10 atmospheres.	According to another general process (C), a compound of general formula (I) may be prepared by cyclising a compound of formula (V): ##STR8## wherein W represents a hydrogen atom and Y represents the group NH, or W represent a halogen atom and Y represents a bond, or a salt or protected derivative thereof, followed where necessary by removal of any protecting groups.	According to one embodiment (a) of process (C), the reaction is effected with a compound of formula (V) wherein W represents a hydrogen atom and Y represents the group NH, and the cyclisation may be carried out in aqueous or non-aqueous media, in the presence of an acid catalyst.	It will be appreciated that these compounds of formula (V) may exist in the corresponding enol hydrazone tautomeric form.	When an aqueous medium is employed this may be water or a mixture of water and a organic solvent such as an alcohol (e.g. methanol, ethanol or isopropanol) or an ether (e.g. dioxan or tetrahydrofuran). The acid catalyst may be, for example, an inorganic acid such as concentrated hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. In some cases the acid catalyst may also act as the reaction solvent. In an anhydrous reaction medium, which may comprise one or more alcohols or ethers (e.g. as described above), carboxylic acids (e.g. acetic acid) or esters (e.g. ethyl acetate), the acid catalyst may alternatively by a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride, zinc chloride or magnesium chloride. The cyclisation reaction may conveniently be carried out at temperatures of from 20° to 200° C., preferably 20° to 125° C.	Alternatively the cyclisation according to embodiment (a) of process (C) may be carried out in the presence of polyphosphate ester in a reaction medium which may comprise one or more organic solvents, preferably halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, or mixtures thereof. Polyphosphate ester is a mixture of esters which may be prepared from phosphorus pentoxide, diethyl ether and chloroform according to the method described in `Reagents for Organic Synthesis`, (Fieser and Fieser, John Wiley and Sons, 1967).	According to another embodiment (b) of process (C), the reaction is effected with a compound of formula (V) wherein W represents a halogen atom, for example, a chlorine atom or, more preferably, a bromine or iodine atom, Y represents a bond, and the cyclisation is effected photochemically.	The reaction may conveniently be effected by irradiating with a mercury lamp, preferably a medium or high pressure mercury lamp. Suitable solvents include nitriles (e.g. acetonitrile), chlorinated hydrocarbons (e.g. carbon tetrachloride) and cyclic ethers (e.g. tetrahydrofuran or dioxan) and mixtures thereof. The reaction may conveniently be effected in the presence of abase such as a tertiary amine (e.g. triethylamine).	According to another general process (D), a compound of general formula (I) wherein R3 represents a hydrogen atom, may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula (VI): ##STR9##	or a protected derivative thereof, with formamide, at a temperature in the range of 150° to 200° C., followed where necessary by removal of any protecting groups.	According to another general process (E), a compound of general formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (VII): ##STR10##	wherein G represents a hydrogen atom, or a protected derivative thereof, with phosgene in the presence of a Lewis acid; or by reacting a compound of formula (VII) wherein G represents an iodine or a bromine atom, or a protected derivative thereof, with carbon monoxide in the presence of a palladium (II) salt, followed where necessary by removal of any protecting groups.	According to one embodiment of process (E), a compound of formula (VII), wherein G represents a hydrogen atom, is reacted with phosgene in the presence of a Lewis acid such as anhydrous aluminium trichloride or stannic chloride. The reaction may conveniently by effected in an inert solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. toluene) or a halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane), or mixtures thereof, and at a temperature between ambient and 100° C.	According to another embodiment of process (E), a compound of formula (VII), wherein G represents an iodine or a bromine atoms, is reacted with carbon monoxide in the presence of a palladium (II) salt (e.g. palladium acetate or palladium chloride) and preferably in the presence of triphenylphosphine. The reaction may conveniently be effected in a solvent such as a tertiary amine (e.g. tri-n-butylamine), optionally in the presence of a co-solvent such as an ether (e.g. tetrahydrofuran) or an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. toluene), at a temperature in the range 100° to 150° C., and at atmospheric pressure.	According to another general process (F), a compound of general formula (I) may be converted into another compound of formula (I) using conventional techniques. Such conventional techniques include hydrogenation, alkylation and acylation using protection and deprotection where necessary.	Thus, according to one embodiment of the interconversion process (F), hydrogenation may be used to convert an alkenyl or an alkynyl substituent into an alkyl substituent, or an alkynyl into an alkenyl substituent. Hydrogenation may also be used to replace a phenylmethoxymethyl group by a hydrogen atom. Hydrogenation according to general process (F) may be effected using conventional procedures, for example, using hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, as described above in general process (B).	The term `alkylation` according to general process (F) includes the introduction of groups such as cycloalkyl, alkenyl or phenalkyl groups.	Thus, for example, a compound of formula (I) in which R1 represents a C1-6 alkyl, C3-6 alkenyl, C3-10 alkynyl, C3-7 cycloalkyl, C3-7 cycloalkylC1-4 alkyl, phenyl C1-3 alkyl, phenylmethoxymethyl, phenoxyethyl or phenoxymethyl group may be prepared by alkylating a compound of formula (I) in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom, or a compound in which R3 represents a C1-6 alkyl, C3-7 cycloalkyl, C3-6 alkenyl or phenylC1-3 alkyl group may be prepared by alkylating the corresponding compound of formula (I) in which R3 represents a hydrogen atom, using conventional procedures, for example as described in published may be effected using an appropriate alkylating agent of formula R7Z (where R7 is the group to be introduced and Z is a leaving atom or group), preferably in the presence of a base.	According to another embodiment of general process (F), a compound of formula (I) wherein R1 represents --CO2R5, --COR5, --CONR5R6 or --SO2R5 may be prepared by acylating or sulphonylating as appropriate, a compound of formula (I) wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom. The acylation/sulphonylation reactions may be effected using an appropriate acylating/sulphonylating agent according to conventional procedures, for example, as described in published European Patent Specification No. 210840.	It should be appreciated that in the above transformations it may be necessary or desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the molecule of the compound in question to avoid undesirable side reactions. For example, it may be necessary to protect the indole and/or imidazole nitrogen atoms, for example with an arylmethyl (e.g. trityl), arylmethoxymethyl (e.g. phenylmethoxymethyl), alkyl (e.g. t-butyl), alkoxymethyl (e.g. methoxymethyl), acyl (e.g. benzyloxycarbonyl) or a sulphonyl (e.g. N,N-dimethylaminosulphonyl or p-toluenesulphonyl) group.	
US5360800_0005	Thus according to another general process (G), a compound of general formula (I) may be prepared by the removal of any protecting groups from a protected form of a compound of formula (I). Deprotection may be effected using conventional techniques such as those described in `Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis` by T. S. Greene (John Wiley and sons, 1981).	For example, an arylmethoxymethyl N-protecting group may be cleaved by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a catalyst (e.g. palladium on charcoal). A trityl group may be cleaved by acid hydrolysis (e.g. using dilute hydrochloric or acetic acid). An alkoxyalkyl group may be removed using a mineral acid (e.g. dilute hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid). An acyl group may be removed by hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions (e.g. using hydrogen bromide, dilute hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide). A sulphonyl group may also be removed by alkaline or acidic hydrolysis, and an N, N-dimethylaminosulphonyl group may also be removed (e.g. from an imidazole nitrogen atom) by photolysis.	Compounds of formula (II) may be obtained by a Beckmann rearrangement of an oxime of formula (VIII): ##STR11##	wherein m represents 1 or 2, or a protected derivative thereof. The Beckmann rearrangement may be effected using conventional methods, for example by using an acid (e.g. polyphosphoric or sulphuric acid, or a mixture of hydrochloric acid, acetic anhydride and acetic acid) in an inert solvent such as an ether (e.g. dioxan), an amide (e.g. dimethylformamide) or a hydrocarbon (e.g. toluene or cyclohexane), at an elevated temperature of, for example, 50° to 120° C. Alternatively, the hydroxy group of the oxime of formula (VIII), may be converted into a leaving group such as a chloride (using, for example, phosphorus pentachloride) or a hydrocarbylsulphonate (e.g. a mesylate or a tosylate) or a trifluoroacetate group (using conventional acylation methods). Subsequent heating at a temperature of, for example, 20° to 150° C., in an inert solvent as described above, gives a compound of formula (II).	Compounds of formula (VIII) may be prepared from the corresponding tricyclic ketone of formula (IX): ##STR12## wherein m represents 1 or 2, or a protected derivative thereof using conventional methods, for example by using hydroxylamine hydrochloride in a solvent such as pyridine.	Compounds of formula (IV) may be prepared, for example, by reacting a compound of formula (X): ##STR13## or a protected derivative thereof, with a compound of formula (III) wherein L is as defined previously, or a protected derivative thereof, using the conditions described in process (A).	Compounds of formula (X) may be prepared by heating a compound of formula (II) wherein n represents 2, with a noble metal catalyst such as palladium, palladium oxide, platinum or nickel, at a temperature of, for example, 300° to 350° C. The catalyst may be supported on, for example, charcoal or alumina, and the reaction may optionally be carried out in the presence of an inert solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. p-cymene)	Compounds of formula (V) wherein W represents a hydrogen atom and Y represents the group NH may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula (XI): ##STR14## or a salt thereof, with a compound of formula (XII): ##STR15## or a protected derivative thereof, in a suitable solvent such as an aqueous alcohol (e.g. methanol), and at a temperature of, for example, from 20° to 100° C.	A protected derivative of a compound of formula (XII) may for example have the keto carbonyl group protected (e.g. as an enol ether). It will be appreciated that when a compound of formula (XII) is used in which the keto carbonyl group is protected, it may be necessary to remove the protecting group in order for reaction to occur with the compound of formula (XI). Deprotection may be carried out by conventional methods, for example by acidic hydrolysis (e.g. using dilute sulphuric or hydrochloric acid). If desired, deprotection may be effected in situ.	Compounds of formula (XII) may be prepared, for example, by reacting a compound of formula (XIII): ##STR16## or a protected derivative thereof, with a compound of formula (III) wherein L is as defined previously, or a protected derivative thereof, using the conditions described in process (A).	Compounds of formula (V) wherein W represents a halogen atom and Y represents a bond may be prepared, for example, by reacting a compound of formula (XIV): ##STR17## wherein W represents a halogen atom, or a protected derivative thereof, with a compound of formula (III) wherein L is as defined previously, or a protected derivative thereof, using the conditions described in process (A).	Compounds of formula (XIV) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (XV): ##STR18## with a compound of formula (XIII), at an elevated temperature.	Compounds of formula (VI) may be prepared, for example, by reacting a compound of formula (II), or a protected derivative thereof, with a compound of formula (XVI): ##STR19## wherein L is as defined previously, using the conditions described in process (A).	Compounds of formula (VII) wherein G represents a halogen atom may be prepared, for example by reacting a compound of formula (VII) wherein G represents a hydrogen atom, or a protected derivative thereof, with an appropriate halogen and alkali metal halide (e.g. iodine and potassium iodide), in a suitable solvent such as an aqueous alcohol (e.g. aqueous ethanol).	Compounds of formula (VII) wherein G represents a hydrogen atom may be prepared, for example, by reacting a compound of formula (XVII): ##STR20## or a protected derivative thereof, with a compound of formula (III) wherein L is as defined previously, or a protected derivate thereof, using the conditions described in process (A).	Compounds of formula (III) and protected derivative thereof, are either known, or may be prepared, for example, by the methods described in German Offenlegungsschrift No. 3740352.	Compounds of formula (IX) may be prepared, for example, by the method or methods analogous to that described by H. Iida et al. in J. Org. Chem., 1980, 45, 2938.	Compounds of formulae (XI), (XIII), (XV), (XVI) and (XVII) are either known, or may be prepared from known compounds by conventional procedures.	Where it is desired to isolate a compound of the invention as a salt, for example a physiologically acceptable salt, this may be achieved by reacting the compound of formula (I) in the form of the free base with an appropriate acid, preferably with an equivalent amount, in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol (e.g. ethanol or methanol), an aqueous alcohol (e.g. aqueous ethanol), a halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane), an ester (e.g. ethyl acetate) or an ether (e.g. tetrahydrofuran).	Physiologically acceptable salts may also be prepared from other salts, including other physiologically acceptable salts, of the compounds of formula (I) using conventional methods.	Individual enantiomers of the compounds of the invention may be obtained by resolution of a mixture of enantiomers (e.g. a racemic mixture) using conventional means, such as an optically active resolving acid; see for example `Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds` by E. L. Eliel (McGraw Hill, 1962) and `Tables of Resolving Agents` by S. H. Wilen.	The methods described above for preparing the compounds of the invention may be used for the introduction of the desired groups at any stage in the stepwise formation of the required compounds, and it will be appreciated that these methods can be combined in different ways in such multi-stage processes. The sequence of the reactions in multi-stage processes should of course be chosen so that the reaction conditions used do not affect groups in the molecule which are desired in the final product.

Spencer & Frank	A compound of formula (I) ##STR1## wherein R1 and R2 each represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, Z represents a ring selected from: ##STR2##  in which n represents 4, 5 or 6; ##STR3##  in which R3 represents hydrogen or an alkyl group and R4 represents an alkyl, methoxy benzyl or R5NHCO group, R5 being an alkyl group; and ##STR4##  in which R6 represents an alkyl group. and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are useful in the treatment of migraine and other conditions. They are prepares by decarboxylation of the corresponding indolyl 2-carboxylic acid.	This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/211,446, filed Mar. 28, 1994, now abandoned which application is a 371 of PCT/EP93/01901 filed Jul. 19, 1993.	THIS INVENTION relates to new indol derivatives, methods for their preparation, compositions containing them and their use in medical treatment.	The mechanism involved in the genesis of a migraine attack is not known, but it has been demonstrated that the large intracranial vessels are distended during the headache phase. Some compounds like ergotamine and serotonine (5-Hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), have a vasoconstrictor action in the carotid vascular bed by an agonistic action at the "5-HT1 -like" receptors. However, the lack of selectivity of these compounds is the cause of undesirable and potentially dangerous side-effects.	In British Patents 2124210A and 2162532A, new anti-migraine compounds have been disclosed and seem to stimulate more selectively a sub-population of "5-HT1 -like" receptors. Among these compounds, Sumatriptan of formula: ##STR5## is available for migraine therapy. This compound presents a high affinity for 5-HT1D receptor but it has also a very important affinity for 5-HT1A receptor. This affinity for 5-HT1A receptor, causes hypotension by a central nervous system action and other side effects.	We have now found that the introduction of a nitrogen ring in the methanesulfonyl group provides new anti-migraine compounds that present a greater affinity for 5-HT1D receptor than for 5-HT1A receptor and therefore, less side-effects.	Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula: ##STR6## wherein R1 and R2 each represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, Z represents a ring selected from: ##STR7##  in which nrepresents 4, 5 or 6; ##STR8##  in which R3 represents hydrogen or an alkyl group R4 represents an alkyl, methoxy, benzyl or R5NHCO group, R5 being an alkyl group; and ##STR9##  in which R6 represents an alkyl group; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.	The alkyl group mentioned in relation with the groups R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 in compounds of the invention, are usually "lower" alkyl, that is containing up to 6 and particularly up to 4 carbon atoms, the hydrocarbon chain being branched or straight.	The compounds of general formula I wherein R1 and R2 are alkyl groups and Z is II or V are preferred.	According to a feature of the present invention the indol derivatives of general formula I may be prepared by the process which comprises a decarboxylation of a carboxylic acid of general formula VI: ##STR10## (wherein the various symbols are as defined above). The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent as quinoline, tri-n-butylamine, N,N-dimethylacetamide or pyridine, in the presence of a catalyst as copper powder, cupric oxide, cuprous oxide or other copper derivatives, at a temperature between 100° and 200° C.	The intermediates VI used in the preparation of the compounds of the invention, were prepared by known processes described in the literature (A. Gonzalez, Synth. Commun. (1991)), 21, 669; B. A. Howell, J. Chem. Ed. 176 (1984); H. Plieninger, Ber. (1950), 83, 268).	Indol derivatives of general formula I can be converted by methods known per se into acid addition salts with acids in appropriate solvents, for example acetone, alcohols, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran. Suitable acid addition salts are those derived from inorganic acids, for example the hydrochlorides and sulphates.	
US5565447_0003	The experiments with usual test animals were conducted and evaluated in the following manner:	Dog Saphenous Vein	Isometric recordings were performed essentially as described by Humphrey et al (1988). Briefly, lateral saphenous vein ring preparations (3 mm. wide) removed from anaesthetized beagle dogs were suspended under 2g. resting tension, in 30 mL organ baths containing Krebs at 37° C. The experiments were carried out in the presence of 5-HT2, H1 and muscarinic antagonists and serotonin 1 μM was used as quantitative reference standard.	(Humphrey P. P. A.; Feniuk W.; Perren M. J.; Connor H. E.; Oxford A. W .; Coates I. H. and Butina D. (1988). GR 43175, a selective agonist for the 5-HT1-like receptor in dog isolated saphenous vein. Br. J. Pharmac. 94, 1123-1132).	Binding to 5HT1D Receptors	Assays were performed essentially as described by Bruinvels et al. Varying amounts of tested drugs were added to 0.25 mL final volume reaction that included 100 μg of calf caudate nucleus membrane protein, 100 pM (Serotonin-5-0-Carboxymethyl-Glycyl[125I]Tyrosinamide (125I-GTI), 4 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.4. After incubation at 37° C. for 30 minutes, samples were filtered under reduced pressure using glass fibre filters. The filters were washed with ice-cold buffer and dried. Non-specific binding was defined as that obtained in the presence of 10 μM 5HT. Trapped radioactivity was quantified using a gamma counter. Displacement curves were constructed and the concentration displacing 50% of radioligand was calculated for each tested compound using non-linear regression. Data from at least three different assays run in duplicate was averaged. (Bruinvels A. T.; Lery H.; Palacios J. M. and Hoyer D. 5-HT1D binding sites in various species: similar pharmacological profile in dog, monkey, calf, guinea-pig and human brain membranes. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. (in press)).	Binding to 5HT1A receptors	Assays were performed essentially as described by Gozlan et al (1983). Varying amounts of tested drugs were added to 1 mL final volume reaction mixtures that included 100 μg of rat hippocampus membrane protein, 0.5 nM 3H-8-OH-DPAT, 4 mM CaCl2, 0.1% ascorbic acid, 10 μM pargyline and 50 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.4. After incubation at 25° C. for 30 minutes, samples were filtered under reduced pressure using glass fibre filters. The filters were washed with ice-cold buffer and dried. Non-specific binding was defined as that obtained in the presence of 10 μM 5HT. Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting and data was handled as described for the 5HT1D binding assay.

EXAMPLE 1	To a solution of previously dried 1-[[2-carboxy-3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-5-indolyl]methanesulphonyl]pyrrolidine (1.6 g; 0.0442 moles) in anhydrous quinoline (75 ml) and under atmosphere of nitrogen, cuprous oxide (160 mg; 0.0011 moles) was added. The reaction mixture was heated to 190° C. for 15 minutes, stirred to room temperature, poured into a mixture of 1N hydrochloric acid (150 ml) and ethyl acetate (50 ml), shaken and decanted. The aqueous solution was washed several times with ethyl acetate, then solid sodium bicarbonate was added until pH=7.8, and washed with n-hexane to eliminate the quinoline. The aqueous solution was made alkaline with solid potassium carbonate and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic solution was dried (Na2SO4), the solvent removed under reduced pressure when a dark oil was obtained (1.3 g; yield 92%). This product was purified by column chromatography with silica gel and methylene chloride:ethanol:ammonium hydroxide (60:8:1) as eluent and a white foam (0.8 g) of 1-[[3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-5-indolyl]methanesulphonyl]pyrrolidine was obtained.	To a solution of the above product (0.8 g) in acetone (30 ml), a few drops of hydrogen chloride saturated dioxan solution, were added. The precipitated solid was collected by filtration, washed with acetone and dried to give 1-[[3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-5-indolyl]methanesulphonyl]-pyrrolidine hydrochloride (0.75 g). Melting point 218°-220° C.

Soc. 1987, 109, 7111-7115.	Nath & Associates	Nath; Gary M.	Chong; Suet M.	The invention relates to pyrrolidine derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same, and methods of treating cocaine addiction and overdose, and diseases and conditions characterized by abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission, with pyrrolidine derivatives.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	Dopamine is a catecholamine which is one of the principal neurotransmitters present in the central nervous system. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission have been implicated in a variety of disease states including Parkinson's disease, depression, attention deficit disorder, and drug addiction.	The major pathway by which monoamines are inactivated is by being transported back into the cell that released them via specific transporter proteins (i.e. serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporter proteins). The dopamine transporter protein is the carrier molecule which transports dopamine across the synaptic membrane (Hitri et al., Clinical Neuropharmacology, 1994, 17, 1-22). The human dopamine transporter protein was recently cloned, and shown to have several binding sites, including a binding site for cocaine (Giros et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 1992, 42, 383-390).	Major depression, which is characterized by feelings of intense sadness or pessimistic worry, affects approximately 5-10% of the population (Michels, (ed.) Psychiatry Philadelphia: Lipincott, 1992). A variety of medications have shown efficacy in treating depression including the tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin uptake inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (Pinder et al., Med. Res. Rev., 1993, 13, 259-325). All of these compounds work by increasing the synaptic levels of monoamine neurotransmitters. There are several reports in the literature of selective dopamine uptake inhibitors showing efficacy in animal models of depression (Nielsen et al., Adv. Biosci., 1990, 77, 101-108; Randrup et al., Psychopharmacology, 1977, 52, 73-77; Halaris et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 1975, 24, 1896-1897).	Parkinson's disease is a progressive, degenerative neurologic motor disorder produced by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This in turn results in abnormally low levels of dopamine present in the striatum. As a result, drugs that can increase the levels of dopamine have the potential to be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. The most widely prescribed drug in this class is the dopamine precursor levodopa (L-DOPA) (McDowell et al., Ann. Intern. Med., 1970, 72, 29-35). Another mechanism to increase levels of synaptic dopamine is to block its reuptake via inhibition of the dopamine transporter protein. There have been several studies demonstrating that compounds which act by inhibiting the action of the dopamine transporter protein are effective in animal models of Parkinson's Disease (Mayer et al., MPTP: Neurotoxin Prod. Parkinsonian Syndr., Markey et al., ed., 1985, 585-589). For example, the selective dopamine uptake inhibitor GBR 13,098 is effective at preventing MPTP induced toxicity in mice (Pileblad et al., Neuropharmacology, 1985, 24, 689-692).	Attention deficit disorder (ADD) manifests itself primarily in children. The symptoms include an inability to remain focused on a particular task for an extended period of time (Funk et al., Pediatrics, 1993, 91, 816-819). A variety of drugs have been prescribed for this disease, including dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate. Methylphenidate appears to exert its effects by inhibiting the dopamine transporter, more specifically by binding to the cocaine site on the dopamine transporter (Volkow et al., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 1995, 52, 456-63). As a result, compounds which have a similar mode of action at this binding site may also show efficacy in this disease.	Cocaine addiction affects approximately 2.1 million people in the United States (Committee to Study Medication Development and Research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, "Extent of Illicit Drug Use", Development of Medications for the Treatment of Opiate and Cocaine Additions: Issues for the Government and Private Sector, Fulco, Liverman, Earley, Eds., National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 1995, 36-37). In the last decade the molecular site of cocaine's addictive properties has been determined to be the dopamine transporter protein (Kuhar et al., TIPS, 1991, 14, 299-302). It was originally proposed that cocaine was a competitive inhibitor of dopamine uptake, coincident with cocaine and dopamine having common binding domains on the transporter protein. However, recent evidence suggest that dopamine and cocaine binding sites on the DAT are distinct (Kityama et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1992, 89, 7782-7785).	Partial agonists and/or antagonists at the cocaine site on the dopamine transporter protein may show efficacy in treating cocaine addiction. Importantly, several compounds which bind to the cocaine binding site have been shown to block the effects of cocaine in vivo. For example, GBR 12909 has been shown to attenuate cocaine-induced activation of mesolimbic dopamine neurons in rat (Baumann et al., J. Pharm. Exp. Therap., 1994, 271, 1216-1222). Compounds which bind to the cocaine site but do not inhibit dopamine uptake (i.e. a cocaine antagonist) may have utility in the treatment of cocaine addiction (Carroll, FI et al., Pharmaceutical News, 1994, 1, 11-17).	There are currently no medications which effectively treat cocaine addiction. Accordingly, a need exists for compounds having an affinity for the cocaine site on a dopamine transporter protein (DAT), without inhibiting dopamine uptake, to aid in the treatment of cocaine addiction.	A further need exists for compounds which inhibit dopamine uptake to aid in the treatment of neurological disorders characterized by abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission, notably Parkinson's disease, depression, and attention deficit disorder (ADD).	The applicant has discovered new compounds that are useful for the above described treatments, as well as new methods of using known compounds that are related in structure to the new compounds.

EXAMPLES	The following examples are illustrative of the present invention and are not intended to be limitations thereon. All percentages are based on 100% by weight of the final compound.	Example 1 ##STR10##	(S)-(-)-1-propyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol (Compound 2)	(S)-(-)-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol (1) (1.0 g, 4.0 mmol) was added to a flask containing potassium carbonate (1.2 g, 8.7 mmol) and 20 ml of acetonitrile. Propyl iodide (2.0 ml, 21 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture heated to reflux for three hours. At the end of this time, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, added to brine (50 ml), and extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer was washed once with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. This afforded the desired material (2) (0.98 g, 84%) as a white solid.

This was then cooled to -15° C. under an atmosphere of nitrogen. (S)-Tetrahydro-1H,3H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]oxazole-1,3-dione (4)	(1.50 g, 10.6 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (10 ml) was added to the dropping funnel. This solution was then added dropwise to the Grignard reagent at such a rate as to maintain the reaction temperature between -15° C. and -10° C. The addition was complete in approximately 45 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at -15° C. and 1 hour at 0° C. before being poured into a precooled (O° C) solution of sulfuric acid (25 ml, 2.0M). After 5 minutes a thick white precipitate formed. The mixture was cooled for an additional 1 hour, filtered, and washed twice with THF(150 ml). The resulting solution was then concentrated to a volume of 50 ml. This was then cooled to 0° C. and a yellow precipitate formed. After 30 minutes, the precipitate was filtered, washed twice with 20 ml of water and twice with 50 ml of ethyl acetate. The desired material as its sulfate salt was obtained as a white solid (2.0 g, 52%). A portion of the salt (0.50 g, 0.70 mmol) was added to a 1.0M potassium hydroxide solution (10 ml) and stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. At the end of this time, toluene (25 ml) was added and the mixture filtered. The aqueous layer was removed and the organic phase was washed once with water (25 ml). This was then dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure to give the desired product (5) (0.37 g, 84%) as a clear and colorless oil.	1H NMR (DMSO d6) δ1.6-2.2 (m, 4H), 2.1 (s, 6H), 2.3 (s, 1H), 2.8 (m, 2H), 4.15 (t, 1H), 5.1 (s, 1H), 6.9-7.0 (appt, 2H), 7.1-7.5 (m, 4H).	Example 3	(S)-Tetrahydro-1H,3H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]oxazole-1,3-dione (Compound 4)	L-Proline (11.5 g, 0.10 mol) was added to a 500 ml three neck flask fitted with a 125 ml addition funnel, thermometer and a nitrogen inlet tube. To the flask was added dry tetrahydrofuran (115 ml) and the mixture cooled to 15° C. using an ice/water bath. The addition funnel was charged with diphosgene (7.2 ml, 0.06 mol) and dry THF(50 ml). The diphosgene solution was added dropwise to the proline mixture over 45 minutes while maintaining a reaction mixture temperature in the range of 15° to 20° C. Once the addition was complete the mixture was warmed to 35° C. for 1 hour. At the end of this time a clear and colorless solution was obtained. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and concentrated under vacuum to a volume of approximately 50 ml. The residue was redissolved in 115 ml of THF and cooled to 0°-5° C. using an ice bath. Triethylamine (12 ml, 0.086 mol) was added dropwise to the cooled solution over 30 minutes. The solution was stirred a further 30 minutes after which time the solids were filtered and washed with THF(100 ml). The organics were concentrated under reduced pressure to give the desired compound (4) (14 g, 99%) as a light beige solid. The material was stored under nitrogen at -78° C. in order to avoid decomposition, and used without further purification in subsequent reactions.	PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY	Four compounds of formula I were tested in vitro for their ability to displace the cocaine analogue (-)-2-β-[3H]carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane binding at the cocaine site on the dopamine transporter protein (DAT) (expressed as Kibinding), and for their ability to block dopamine uptake into neurons by inhibiting the neuronal dopamine transporter (expressed as Kiuptake).

Thus, the lower the Kibinding values means the greater the ability of the tested compounds to antagonize cocaine's binding to the DAT.	Kiuptake represents the levels of dopamine uptake. The higher the Kiuptake values means the higher the selectivity of the tested compounds in binding to the cocaine site on the DAT and, thus, the lower the inhibition of the functioning of the DAT.	Based on the data in Table I, cocaine is nonselective with an uptake to binding ratio of 1.7. All the tested compounds of formula I exhibit uptake to binding ratios greater than that of cocaine, which mean that the compounds bind potently to the cocaine site on the DAT and have little or no effect on dopamine uptake.	Test Procedures	Values (Ki values) for the binding of compounds at the cocaine binding site of the human dopamine transporter as well as values for the inhibition of dopamine uptake can be obtained using methods described in the literature (Kitayama, S., Shimada, S., Xu, H., Markham, L., Donovan, D. M., and Uhl, G. R. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 89, 7782-7785). Below are the experimental procedures for the assay of compounds.	
US5650521_0005	All assays were performed using Chinese Hamster Ovary cells stably expressing the human dopamine transporter cDNA (hDAT cells). hDAT cells were distributed in 96-well plates and grown 3 to 4 days to confluency (~105 cells/well) in Ham's F12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. To facilitate comparisons, dopamine uptake and cocaine analogue binding were performed under identical conditions including assay buffers, temperature and time as detailed below.	[3H]DOPAMINE UPTAKE	To assess [3H]dopamine uptake, the hDAT cells were washed two times in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer containing 100 μM ascorbic acid (KRH+) at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with 100 nM [3H]dopamine (24.1 Ci/mmol; NEN) in KRH+ buffer for 6 minutes at room temperature. Co-incubation with 100 mM unlabeled (-) cocaine in parallel incubations allowed estimation of nonspecific uptake. Uptake was terminated by five washes with ice-cold KRH+ and radioactivity was quantitated using a Packard TopLoad Scintillation Counter.	For uptake inhibition studies, cells were pre-incubated with the test compound for 2 hours in cell culture medium at 37° C. Subsequently, the hDAT cells were washed two times in KRH+ buffer at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with 100 nM [3H]dopamine and test compound in KRH+ buffer at room temperature for 6 minutes. Binding was terminated and quantified as above. Data was analyzed and inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated using the Origin™ computer program by Microcal Software, Inc.	[3H]CFT BINDING	To assess binding of the cocaine analogue (-)-2β-[3H]carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (CFT), the hDAT cells were washed two times in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with 5 nM [3H]CFT (87 Ci/mmol; NEN) in KRH buffer for 6 minutes at room temperature. Co-incubation with 100 μM unlabeled (-)cocaine in parallel incubations allowed estimation of nonspecific binding. Binding was terminated by five washes with ice-cold KRH and radioactivity was quantitated using a Packard TopLoad Scintillation Counter.	For binding inhibition studies, the hDAT cells were pre-incubated with test compound for 2 hours in cell culture medium at 37° C. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times in KRH buffer at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with 5 nM [3H]CFT and test compound in KRH buffer at room temperature for 6 minutes. Binding was terminated and quantified as above. Data was analyzed and inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated using the Origin™ computer program by Microcal Software, Inc.

This activity is useful in the treatment of cocaine addiction and overdose.	The compounds of the present invention which bind at the cocaine site, but are not completely selective, may inhibit dopamine reuptake. This activity is useful in the treatment of disease states and conditions characterized by abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission, including without limitation: Parkinson's disease, depression, attention deficit disorder (ADD), hypertension, congestive heart failure, acute and chronic renal failure, angina, hyperprolatenemia, psychoses, galactorrhea, menstrual disorders, sexual dysfunction, Huntington's chorea, and schizophrenia.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives find use in the preparation of injectables, olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant.	The compounds may be administered orally in the form of capsules or tablets, for example, or as an aqueous suspension or solution. In the case of tablets or oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is optimally combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added.	The compounds of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.	The compounds of this invention may also be administered optically, especially when the conditions addressed for treatment involve areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, including neurological disorders of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas.	For ophthalmic use, the compounds can be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with or without a preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively for the ophthalmic uses the compounds may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.	For application topically to the skin, the compounds can be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the compound suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture with one or more of the following: mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water.

The above discussion relating to the utility and administration of the compounds of the present invention is also applicable to the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, and thus is hereby incorporated by reference.	Methods of Treating Disease States and Conditions Characterized by Abnormal Dopaminergic Neurotransmission	Compounds which bind at the cocaine site and are not completely selective may inhibit dopamine reuptake. Compounds such as these may have utility in treating diseases in which low levels of dopamine have been implicated. The most notable disease states in this class are depression and Parkinson's disease.	Thus, the present invention also relates to methods of treating disease states and conditions characterized by abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission, which comprises administering to a host suffering therefrom a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula ##STR17## or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein the compound is an R- or S-enantiomer;	the pyrrolidine ring is saturated or unsaturated;	R1, R2, R3 and R4 are independently selected from the group consisting of H, C1 -C6 alkyl, hydroxy, carboxy, alkoxy and substituted C1 -C6 alkyl group;	Ar1 and Ar2 are independently selected from the group consisting of an unsubstituted phenyl radical, a monosubstituted phenyl radical, and a multisubstituted phenyl radical, with substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, C1 -C6 alkyl, substituted alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, and carboxy.	The treated disease states and conditions include but not limited to Parkinson's disease, depression, attention deficit disorder (ADD), hypertension, congestive heart failure, acute and chronic renal failure, angina, hyperprolatenemia, psychoses, galactorrhea, menstrual disorders, sexual dysfunction, Huntington's chorea, and schizophrenia. Preferably, the treated disease states and conditions are selected from the group consisting of Parkinson's disease, depression, and attention deficit disorder (ADD).	More preferably, the compound administered for treatment is selected from the group consisting of:	(S)-(-)-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(R)-(-)-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(S)-(-)-1-methyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(R)-(+)-1-methyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(S)-(-)-1-ethyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(R)-(+)-1-ethyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(S)-(-)-1-propyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(R)-(+)-1-propyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	
US5650521_0006	(S)-(-)-1-butyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(R)-(+)-1-butyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol; and	(S)-α,α-Bis(3-methyl-4-fluorophenyl)-2-pyrrolidinemethanol.	Methods of Treating Cocaine Addiction and Overdose	Cocaine exerts its reinforcing properties by facilitating the action of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the mesolimbocortical pathways of the brain, a region responsible for the regulation of pleasure and reward. Cocaine does so by inhibiting the functioning of the dopamine transporter (DAT) protein. This inhibition results in excess levels of synaptic dopamine and enhanced dopaminergic transmission.	In 1992, two independent laboratories reported the molecular cloning of the human DAT. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies employing the DAT clone demonstrated that dopamine uptake and cocaine binding occur at distinct sites on the transporter protein. This is significant because it means that drugs can be designed to specifically inhibit cocaine recognition by the DAT while permitting the transporter to maintain its function of accumulating dopamine. This selectivity is important because such a drug would block the physiological effects of cocaine while leaving normal dopamine transmission within the brain intact.	Accordingly, selective cocaine antagonists and mixed agonist/antagonists may have clinical utility in the treatment of cocaine addiction and overdose. Specifically, such compounds would exhibit high uptake to binding ratios (Kiuptake /Kibinding), which mean that the compounds would bind potently to the cocaine site on the dopamine transporter protein (expressed as Kibinding) and have little or no effect on dopamine uptake (expressed as Kiuptake). Stated in other terms, the compounds would antagonize cocaine's binding to the DAT while exhibiting minimal effects on transport function.	Thus, the present invention also relates to methods of treating cocaine addiction or overdose, which comprises administering to a host suffering therefrom a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula ##STR18## or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein the compound is an R- or S-enantiomer;	the pyrrolidine ring is saturated or unsaturated;	R1, R2, R3 and R4 are independently selected from the group consisting of H, C1 -C6 alkyl, hydroxy, carboxy, alkoxy and substituted C1 -C6 alkyl group;	Ar1 and Ar2 are independently selected from the group consisting of an unsubstituted phenyl radical, a monosubstituted phenyl radical, and a multisubstituted phenyl radical, with substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, C1 -C6 alkyl, substituted alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, and carboxy.	In a preferred embodiment, the compound administered for treating cocaine addiction or overdose is selected from the group consisting of:	(S)-(-)-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(R)-(-)-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(S)-(-)-1-methyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(R)-(+)-1-methyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(S)-(-)-1-ethyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(R)-(+)-1-ethyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(S)-(-)-1-propyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(R)-(+)-1-propyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(S)-(-)-1-butyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol;	(R)-(+)-1-butyl-α,α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanol; and	(S)-α,α-Bis(3-methyl-4-fluorophenyl)-2-pyrrolidinemethanol.

Methods of preparing the compounds, intermediates  useful in the preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing the   compounds are also included. The compounds are useful in treating pain,    cerebral ischemia, and other cerebrovascular disorders.	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional application No.     60/002,723 filed Aug. 24, 1995.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	The present invention relates to novel substituted quinolines and           isoquinolines thereof useful as pharmaceutical agents, to methods of their production, compositions which include these compounds and a               pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and to pharmaceutical methods of      treatment. The novel compounds of the present invention are useful in the  treatment of neurological disorders such as traumatic brain injury,        cerebral ischemia, stroke, migraine, acute and chronic pain, epilepsy,     Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,   multiple sclerosis, and depression. The compounds may also be useful for   the treatment of nonneurological disorders such as asthma.	The entry of excessive amounts of calcium ion into neurons following an     ischemic episode or other neuronal trauma has been well documented.        Uncontrolled high concentrations of calcium in neurons initiates a cascade of biochemical events that disrupt normal cellular processes. Among these  events are the activation of proteases and lipases, breakdown of neuronal  membranes and the formation of free radicals which may ultimately lead to  cell death. In particular, the selective N-type calcium channel blocker,   SNX-111, has demonstrated activity in a number of models of ischemia and   pain (Bowersox S.

Alkoxy is as defined above in alkyl but attached via an oxygen.	Aryl refers to a mono- or bicyclic carbocyclic aromatic ring, for example,  but not limited to, phenyl and naphthyl. The aryl group may be             unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents selected from     alkyl, halogen, OH, OCH3, NO2, and NHCOalkyl, preferably         NHCOOCH3.	Heteroaryl is a mono- or polycyclic aromatic ring which contains a          heteroatom, for example, but not limited to furanyl, thienyl, and          isoquinolinyl.	Heteroarylalkyl is as above for alkyl and heteroaryl, for example, but not  limited to 2-(2-thienyl)ethyl, 2-thienylmethyl, 2-pyridylmethyl, and the   like.	Arylalkyl is defined as above in the terms alkyl and aryl as is, for        example, and not limited to, benzyl, 2-phenylethyl, and 3-phenylpropyl is, for example, 4-phenylbutyl.	Carbocyclic ring is a 5- to 7-membered saturated or unsaturated ring and    includes, for example, but not limited to, cyclopentane, cyclopentene,     cyclohexane, cyclohexene, cycloheptane, cycloheptene, indane, and          tetralin.	Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine; fluorine, chlorine, and  bromine are preferred.	The compounds of Formula I are capable of further forming both              pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition and/or base salts. All of these  forms are within the scope of the present invention.	Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula I include salts derived from nontoxic inorganic acids such as              hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydriodic,        hydrofluoric, phosphorous, and the like, as well as the salts derived from nontoxic organic acids, such as aliphatic mono-, di-, and tricarboxylic    acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids,          alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids,  etc. Such salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite,     bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate,          trifluoroacetate, propionate, caprylate, isobutyrate, oxalate, malonate,   succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, benzoate,     chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, phthalate,                benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, phenylacetate, citrate, lactate,       maleate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, and the like. Also contemplated are   salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like and gluconate,          galacturonate (see, for example, Berge S. M., et al., "Pharmaceutical      Salts," J. of Pharma. Sci., 1977;66:1.	The acid addition salts of said basic compounds are prepared by contacting  the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce the salt in the conventional manner. Preferably, a compound of Formula I   can be converted to an acidic salt by treating with an aqueous solution of the desired acid, such that the resulting pH is less than four. The free   base form may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with a base and   isolating the free base in the conventional manner. The free base forms    differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical       properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts   are equivalent to their respective free base for purposes of the present   invention.	Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts are formed with metals or   amines, such as alkali and alkaline earth metals or organic amines.        Examples of metals used as cations are sodium, potassium, magnesium,       calcium, and the like. Examples of suitable amines are                     N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine,     dicyclohexylamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, and procaine (see,  for example, Berge S. M., et al., "Pharmaceutical Salts," J. of Pharma.    Sci., 1977;66:1.	The base addition salts of said acidic compounds are prepared by contacting the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in the conventional manner. Preferably, a compound of Formula I   can be converted to a base salt by treating with an aqueous solution of    the desired base, such that the resulting pH is greater than nine. The     free acid form may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with an acid and isolating the free acid in the conventional manner. The free acid      forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts   are equivalent to their respective free acid for purposes of the present   invention.	Certain of the compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated   forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms, including hydrated forms, are equivalent to unsolvated     forms and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present   invention.	Certain of the compounds of the present invention possess one or more       chiral centers and each center may exist in the R or S configuration. The  present invention includes all enantiomeric and epimeric forms as well as  the appropriate mixtures thereof.	BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY	The compounds of the invention exhibit valuable biological properties       because of their ability to potently block calcium flux through N-type     voltage-gated calcium channels. To measure interaction at the N-type       Ca2+ channel and calcium flux inhibition, the effects of the calcium  channel blockers were measured in the assays described below.	Chick Whole-Brain Synaptosomal 45Calcium Flux Assay	Chicken brain synaptosomes contain voltage sensitive calcium channels which are inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of ω-contoxins and are     therefore considered to be primarily N-type (Lundy P. M., Hamilton M. G.,  Frew R., Brain Res., 1994;643:204-210). 45Ca flux into the           synaptosomes may be induced by stimulation of the synaptosomal membrane    with elevated potassium concentrations. A compound is assessed at various  concentrations for its ability to inhibit this potassium stimulated        calcium influx.	Methods	One- to five-week old chicks were killed by decapitation and whole brain    was removed. The brainstem was discarded, and the remaining brain tissue   was placed in ice-cold sucrose buffer (composition: 320 mM sucrose, 5.0 mM TRIS base, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.3 with HCl). The total wet weight of pooled brain tissue was determined, and the tissue was homogenized in   10 mL sucrose buffer per gram wet weight. A Potter S-type homogenizer (B.  Braun Co.) with a glass tube and teflon pestle was used. Five strokes at   500 rpm were followed by four strokes at 800 rpm. The homogenate was       poured into cold centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3000   rpm (1,075 g) in a refrigerated 4° C. RC-5 centrifuge (Sorvall)     using an SS-34 rotor. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at     11,500 rpm (15,800 g) for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and   the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL sucrose buffer. Cold incubation buffer  (composition: 1.2 mM MgCl2, 22 mM HEPES, 11 mM glucose, 3 mM KCl, 136 mM choline chloride, pH adjusted to 7.3 with TRIS base) was added slowly   to the suspension for a total volume of 30-40 mL. This mixture was         centrifuged at 7,000 rpm (5,856 g) for 5 minutes. The supernatant was      discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of incubation buffer per gram of original wet weight of brain. This synaptosomal suspension was     kept on ice until the start of the assay, at which time 25 μL of        synaptosome suspension were added to each well of a 96-well filter plate   (Millipore) which contained 75 μL incubation buffer with or without     drug. Drugs were dissolved in DMSO or H2O, and the concentration of  DMSO was less than or equal to 1%.	Synaptosomes were pre-incubated in the presence or absence of drug for 5    minutes at room temperature before the addition of radioactive calcium.    Drugs were present throughout the assay. Two μCi/mL stocks of 45   CaCl2 were prepared in basal buffer (composition: incubation buffer   plus 1 mM CaCl2) and in stimulation buffer (composition: 1.2 mM       MgCl2, 22 mM HEPES, 11 mM glucose, 37 mM KCl, 102 mM choline          chloride, 1 mM CaCl2, pH adjusted to 7.3 with TRIS base). One hundred microliter of radioactive basal or stimulation buffer were pipetted into a pre-incubated plate of synaptosomes, using a Quadra 96 pipetter (Tomtec).  The final KCl concentration was 3 mM for the basal condition and 20 mM for the stimulated condition; the final CaCl2 concentration was 0.5 mM    with 1 μCi/mL of 45CaCl2. The plate was filtered under       vacuum after a 30-second incubation with radioactivity. The filters were   washed twice with 200 μL of wash buffer (composition: 140 mM choline    chloride, 3 mM EGTA, 22 mM HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.3 with TRIS base).      Plates were allowed to dry completely. Scintillation fluid was added (20   μL/well), and the plates were counted in a Wallace Microbeta plate      counter. Basal 45CaCl2 flux (3 mM KCl) was subtracted from      stimulated 45CaCl2 flux (20 mM KCl) in both control and         drug-treated conditions, and data were expressed as percent inhibition of  the adjusted control response. Values obtained in this way were plotted as a function of drug concentration and IC50 values were calculated.	Measurement of N-type Ca2+ Channel Blocking Potencies of Compounds in       IMR-32 Cells Using the Fluorescent Ca2+ Indicator Indo-1	
US5767129_0004	IMR-32 cells are a human tumoral cell line of neural origin. The IMR-32     cell line has been shown to contain both N- and L-type voltage sensitive   calcium channels. Calcium flux into these cells may be induced by          stimulation with elevated potassium concentrations. The L-channel          component of calcium flux may be blocked by adding 5 μM nitrendipine.   The remaining component of calcium entry into the IMR-32 cells is due to   calcium flux through N-type calcium channels. Intracellular calcium        concentrations are measured using the fluorescent calcium indicator        Indo-1. The effect of drug concentration on calcium uptake is studied.	Methods	The IMR-32 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.). Cells were grown in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium     with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-Gln    and antibiotic/antimicotic mixture (Gibco). At approximately 80%           confluency, differentiation was induced by the addition of 1 mM dibutyryl  cAMP and 2.5 μM bromodeoxyuridine to the medium. After 7 to 13 days of  differentiation, cells were detached using 0.5 mM EDTA and loaded with     five 5 μM Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.)  at 30° C. for 45 minutes. Loaded cells were washed twice,           resuspended (~107 cells/mL) in assay buffer (10 mM HEPES/Tris   pH 7.4 in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution without bicarbonate or phenol red  containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and kept on ice until use.           Fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Photon Technology          International (PTI, South Brunswick, N.J.) Model RF-F3004                  spectrofluorometer with dual emission monochromators using excitation at   350 nm and emission at 400 and 490 nm. The instrument was equipped with a  thermostatted cuvette holder with stirring capabilities as well as with a  computer-controlled pump which allowed for reagent addition during         measurement. Instrument control and data collection was done by PTI's      OSCAR software running on an IBM compatible computer. Different            concentrations of the test compounds (60 μL in dimethyl sulfoxide) were added to 5.94 mL of assay buffer containing approximately 3×106 loaded cells, and 5 μM Nitrendipine (in 30 μL EtOH) to block L-type  Ca2+ channels. Samples were incubated for 10 minutes at 30° C. and then aliquoted into three 10×10 mm disposable acrylic cuvettes.  Emission signals at 400 and 490 nm were acquired from each cuvette at      30° C. for 50 seconds. At 20 seconds after the start of reading,    cells were depolarized by the addition of 160 μL of stimulation         solution (1M KCl, 68 mM CaCl2) to the cuvette via the                 computer-controlled pump. Ratio of dual emission signals (400 nm/490 nm),  which is proportional to intracellular Ca2+ concentration, was        plotted against time, and the difference between maximal response after    stimulation and basal value (before stimulation) was determined. Values    obtained in this way were plotted as a function of drug concentration.     IC50 values of test compounds were calculated by fitting a            four-parameter logistic function to the data using the least squares       method.

This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/026,514, filed Sep. 23, 1996.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	Cysteine proteinases containing a highly reactive cysteine residue with a free thiol group at the active site have been known as playing an important role in certain conditions distinguished by aberrant protein turnover such as: muscular dystrophy (Am. J. Pathol. 1986, 122, 193-198; Am. J. Pathol. 1987, 127, 461-466), myocardial infarction (J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1983, 2, 681-688), bone resorption (Biochem. J. 1991, 279, 167-274; J. Biol. Chem. 1996, 271, 2126-2132; and Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1992, 1116, 57-66), arthritis (Arthritis Rheumatism 1994, 37, 236-247; and Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992, 44, 1201-1207), cancer metastasis (Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990, 9, 333-352), pulmonary emphysema (Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1975, 111, 579-586), septic shock (Immunol. Today 1991, 11, 404-410, Biochemistry 1994, 33, 3934-3940), cerebral ischemia, memory function, Alzheimer and cataract (TIPS 1994, 15, 412-419, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995, 4, 387-392, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1991, 88, 10998-11002), malaria (J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 5031-5037), glomerular basement membrane degradation (Biochem Bioph. Acta 1989, 990, 246-251), bacterial infection (Nature 1989, 337, 385-386), inflammatory diseases (Protein Science 1995, 4, 3-12), parasitic infections (Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993, 47, 821-853; Parasitol. Today 1990, 6, 270-275), and viral infections (Biochem. 1992, 31, 7862-7869).	A variety of cysteine proteinases have been shown to be present in mammalian tissue. The most notable of these proteinases are the lysosomal cathepsins (cathepsin B, H, S, L and K) and the cytoplasmic Ca+2 dependent enzymes, the calpains. These enzymes are, therefore, excellent targets for specific inhibitors as therapeutic agents for the conditions such as those noted above.	Cysteine proteinases are inhibited by several types of peptide derived inhibitors such as peptidyl aldehyde (Eur. J. Biochem. 1982, 129, 33-41), chloromethyl ketone (Acta. Biol. Med. Ger. 1981, 40, 1503-1511), diazomethyl ketone (Biochemistry 1977, 16, 5857-5861), monofluoromethyl ketone (Biochemical Pharmacology 1992 44, 1201-1207), acyloxy methyl ketone (J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 1833-1840), O-acyl hydroxamates (Biochem. Biophy. Research Communications 1988, 155, 1201-1206), methyl sulphonium salts (J. Biol. Chem. 1988, 263, 2768-2772) and epoxy succinyl derivatives (Agric. Biol. Chem. 1978, 42, 523-527) without significantly inhibiting other classes of proteinases.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	Our laboratory has been extensively involved in search for novel cysteine proteinase regulators and found that 4-substituted-3-(amino-2-cycloalkyl methyl)-acetamido azetidin-2-one derivatives exhibit excellent activity and selectivity within the class of cysteine proteinases. There is an ongoing need to improve in vivo efficacy by improving plasma stability and pharmacokinetics. ##STR2##	The molecular modelling of 3-substituted phenyl alanyl azetidinone suggested that the replacement of phenyl alanine with cyclohexyl alanine might increase the hydrophobic binding with cysteine proteinases. Unfortunately, there is no increase in activity as expected but it showed improved stability in plasma and good in vivo activity.

US6156756_0002	The invention provides new triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine compounds, their use as medicaments, compositions containing them and processes for their preparation.	This application is a 371 of PCT/SE98/01392 filed Jul. 15, 1998.	The present invention provides new triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine compounds, their use as medicaments, compositions containing them and processes for their preparation. Platelet adhesion and aggregation are initiating events in arterial thrombosis. Although the process of platelet adhesion to the sub-endothelial surface may have an important role to play in the repair of damaged vessel walls, the platelet aggregation that this initiates can precipitate acute thrombotic occlusion of vital vascular beds, leading to events with high morbidity such as myocardial infarction and unstable angina. The success of interventions used to prevent or alleviate these conditions, such as thrombolysis and angioplasty is also compromised by platelet mediated occlusion or re-occlusion.	A number of converging pathways lead to platelet aggregation. Whatever the initial stimulus, the final common event is a cross linking of platelets by binding of fibrinogen to a membrane binding site, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIa). The high anti-platelet efficacy of antibodies or antagonists for GPIIb/IIIa is explained by their interference with this final common event. However, this efficacy may also explain the bleeding problems that have been observed with this class of agent. Thrombin can produce platelet aggregation largely independently of other pathways but substantial quantities of thrombin are unlikely to be present without prior activation of platelets by other mechanisms. Thrombin inhibitors such as hirudin are highly effective anti-thrombotic agents, but again may produce excessive bleeding because they function as both anti-platelet and anti-coagulant agents (The TIMI 9a Investigators (1994), Circulation 90, pp. 1624-1630; The Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) IIa Investigators (1994) Circulation 90, pp. 1631-1637; Neuhaus K. L. et. al. (1994) Circulation 90, pp.1638-1642).	It has been found that ADP acts as a key mediator of thrombosis. A pivotal role for ADP is supported by the fact that other agents, such as adrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, serotonin) will only produce aggregation in the presence of ADP. The limited anti-thrombotic efficacy of aspirin may reflect the fact that it blocks only one source of ADP which is that released in a thromboxane-dependent manner following platelet adhesion (see e.g. Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration (1994), Br. Med. J. 308, pp. 81-106; Antiplatelet Trialists Collaboration (1994), Br. Med. J. 308, pp.159-168). Aspirin has no effect on aggregation produced by other sources of ADP, such as damaged cells or ADP released under conditions of turbulent blood flow. ADP-induced platelet aggregation is mediated by the P2T -receptor subtype uniquely located on the platelet membrane. Recently it has been shown that antagonists at this receptor offer significant improvements over other anti-thrombotic agents. Accordingly there is a need to find P2T -antagonists as anti-thrombotic agents.	It has now been found that a series of triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine derivatives are P2T -antagonists.

Salts of the compounds of formula (I) may be formed by reacting the free acid, or a salt thereof, or the free base, or a salt or a derivative thereof, with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base (for example ammonium hydroxide optionally substituted by C1-6 -alkyl or an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide) or acid (for example a hydrohalic (especially HCl), sulphuric, oxalic or phosphoric acid). The reaction may be carried out in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble or in a solvent in which the salt is soluble, e.g. water, ethanol, THF or diethyl ether, which may be removed in vacuo, or by freeze drying. The reaction may also be a metathetical process or it may be carried out on an ion exchange resin. The non-toxic physiologically acceptable salts are preferred, although other salts may be useful, e.g. in isolating or purifying the product.	The compounds of the invention act as P2T -receptor antagonists. Accordingly, the compounds are useful in therapy, especially adjunctive therapy, particularly they are indicated for use as: inhibitors of platelet activation, aggregation and degranulation, anti-thrombotic agents or in the treatment or prophylaxis of unstable angina, coronary angioplasty (PTCA), myocardial infarction, perithrombolysis, primary arterial thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis such as thrombotic or embolic stroke, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction with or without thrombolysis, arterial complications due to interventions in atherosclerotic disease such as angioplasty, endarterectomy, stent placement, coronary and other vascular graft surgery, thrombotic complications of surgical or mechanical damage such as tissue salvage following accidental or surgical trauma, reconstructive surgery including skin and muscle flaps, conditions with a diffuse thrombotic/platelet consumption component such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, thrombotic complications of septicaemia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, anti-phospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, or venous thrombosis such as deep vein thrombosis, venoocclusive disease, haematological conditions such as myeloproliferative disease, including thrombocythaemia; or in the prevention of mechanically-induced platelet activation in vivo, such as cardio-pulmonary bypass (prevention of microthromboembolism), mechanically-induced platelet activation in vitro, such as use in the preservation of blood products, e.g. platelet concentrates, or shunt occlusion such as in renal dialysis and plasmapheresis, thrombosis secondary to vascular damage/inflammation such as vasculitis, arteritis, glomerulonephritis, inflammatory bowel disease and organ graft rejection, conditions such as migraine, Raynaud's phenomenon, atheromatous plaque formation/progression, vascular stenosis/restenosis and asthma, in which platelet-derived factors are implicated in the disease process.	According to the invention there is further provided the use of a compound according to the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of the above disorders. In particular the compounds of the invention are useful for treating myocardial infarction, thrombotic stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, peripheral vascular disease and angina, especially unstable angina. The invention also provides a method of treatment of the above disorders which comprises administering to a patient suffering from such a disorder a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention.	The compounds may be administered topically, e.g. to the lung and/or the airways, in the form of solutions, suspensions, HFA aerosols and dry powder formulations; or systemically, e.g. by oral administration in the form of tablets, pills, capsules, syrups, powders or granules, or by parenteral administration in the form of sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, by subcutaneous administration, or by rectal administration in the form of suppositories or transdermally.	The compounds of the invention may be administered on their own or as a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of the invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, adjuvant or carrier. Particularly preferred are compositions not containing material capable of causing an adverse, e.g. an allergic, reaction.	Dry powder formulations and pressurized HFA aerosols of the compounds of the invention may be administered by oral or nasal inhalation. For inhalation the compound is desireably finely divided.	The compounds of the invention may also be administered by means of a dry powder inhaler. The inhaler may be a single or a multi dose inhaler, and may be a breath actuated dry powder inhaler.	One possibility is to mix the finely divided compound with a carrier substance, e.g. a mono-, di- or polysaccharide, a sugar alcohol or another polyol. Suitable carriers include sugars and starch. Alternatively the finely divided compound may be coated by another substance. The powder mixture may also be dispensed into hard gelatine capsules, each containing the desired dose of the active compound.	Another possibility is to process the finely divided powder into spheres which break up during the inhalation procedure. This spheronized powder may be filled into the drug reservoir of a multidose inhaler, e.g. that known as the Turbuhaler® in which a dosing unit meters the desired dose which is then inhaled by the patient. With this system the active compound with or without a carrier substance is delivered to the patient.	The pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of the invention may conveniently be tablets, pills, capsules, syrups, powders or granules for oral administration; sterile parenteral or subcutaneous solutions, suspensions for parenteral administration or suppositories for rectal administration.	For oral administration the active compound may be admixed with an adjuvant or a carrier, e.g. lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches such as potato starch, corn starch or amylopectin, cellulose derivatives, a binder such as gelatine or polyvinylpyrrolidone, and a lubricant such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, polyethylene glycol, waxes, paraffin, and the like, and then compressed into tablets. If coated tablets are required, the cores, prepared as described above, may be coated with a concentrated sugar solution which may contain e.g. gum arabic, gelatine, talcum, titanium dioxide, and the like. Alternatively, the tablet may be coated with a suitable polymer dissolved either in a readily volatile organic solvent or an aqueous solvent.	For the preparation of soft gelatine capsules, the compound may be admixed with e.g. a vegetable oil or polyethylene glycol. Hard gelatine capsules may contain granules of the compound using either the above mentioned excipients for tablets, e.g. lactose, saccharose, sorbitol , mannitol, starches, cellulose derivatives or gelatine. Also liquid or semisolid formulations of the drug may be filled into hard gelatine capsules.	Liquid preparations for oral application may be in the form of syrups or suspensions, for example solutions containing the compound, the balance being sugar and a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol and propylene glycol. Optionally such liquid preparations may contain colouring agents, flavouring agents, saccharine and carboxymethylcellulose as a thickening agent or other excipients known to those skilled in art.	The invention is illustrated by the following examples. In the examples the NMR spectra were measured on a Varian Unity Inova 300 or 400 spectrometer and the MS spectra were measured as follows: EI spectra were obtained on a VG 70-250S or Finnigan Mat Incos-XL spectrometer, FAB spectra were obtained on a VG70-250SEQ spectrometer, ESI and APCI spectra were obtained on Finnigan Mat SSQ7000 or a Micromass Platform spectrometer. Preparative HPLC separations were generally performed using a Novapak®, Bondapak® or Hypersil® column packed with BDSC-18 reverse phase silica. Flash chromatography (indicated in the Examples as (SiO2)) was carried out using Fisher Matrix silica, 35-70 μm. Organic solubles were dried over magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate and the drying agent removed by filtration. For examples which showed the presence of rotamers in the proton nmr, only the chemical shifts for the major rotamer are quoted.

Human venous blood (100 ml) was divided equally between 3 tubes, each containing 3.2% trisodium citrate (4 ml) as anti-coagulant. The tubes were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 240 G to obtain a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to which 300 ng/ml prostacyclin was added to stabilize the platelets during the washing procedure. Red cell free PRP was obtained by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 125 G followed by further centrifugation for 15 minutes at 640 G. The supernatant was discarded and the platelet pellet resuspended in modified, Calcium Free Tyrode solution (10 ml) (CFT), composition: NaCl 137 mM, NaHCO3 11.9 mM, NaH2PO4 0.4 mM, KCI 2.7 mM, MgCl2 1.1 mM, dextrose 5.6 mM, gassed with 95% O2 /5% CO2 and maintained at 37° C.. Following addition of a further 300 ng/ml PGI2, the pooled suspension was centrifuged once more for 15 minutes at 640 G. The supernatant was discarded and the platelets resuspended initially in 10 ml CFT with further CFT added to adjust the final platelet count to 2×105 /ml. This final suspension was stored in a 60 ml syringe at 3° C. with air excluded. To allow recovery from PGI-inhibition of normal function, platelets were used in aggregation studies no sooner than 2 hours after final resuspension.	In all studies, 3 ml aliquots of platelet suspension were added to tubes containing CaCl2 solution (60 μl of 50 mM solution with a final concentration of 1 mM). Human fibrinogen (Sigma, F 4883) and 8-sulphophenyltheophylline (8-SPT which was used to block any P1 -agonist activity of compounds) were added to give final concentrations of 0.2 mg/ml (60 μl of 10 mg/ml solution of clottable protein in saline) and 300 nM (10 l of 15 mM solution in 6% glucose), respectively. Platelets or buffer as appropriate were added in a volume of 150 μl to the individual wells of a 96 well plate. All measurements were made in triplicate in platelets from each donor.	The agonist/antagonist potency was assessed as follows.	Aggregation responses in 96 well plates were measured using the change in absorbance given by the plate reader at 660 nm. Either a Bio-Tec Ceres 900C or a Dynatech MRX were used as the plate reader.	The absorbance of each well in the plate was read at 660 nm to establish a baseline figure. Saline or the appropriate solution of test compound was added to each well in a volume of 10 μl to give a final concentration of 0, 0.01, 0. 1, 1, 10 or 100 mM. The plate was then shaken for 5 min on an orbital shaker on setting 10 and the absorbance read at 660 nm. Aggregation at this point was indicative of agonist activity of the test compound. Saline or ADP (30 mM; 10 μl of 450 mM) was then added to each well and the plate shaken for a further 5 min before reading the absorbance again at 660 nm.	Antagonist potency was estimated as a % inhibition of the control ADP response to obtain an IC50. Compounds exemplified have pIC50 values of greater than 5.0.	What is claimed is:	1.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION	Compounds of the formula I may be prepared according to the following reaction Schemes and discussion. Unless otherwise indicated, g, m, p, q, R1, R2, R3, R4 , R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10 , R11, R12, G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, E and X as used in the structural formulae I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VI′, VII, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII XVIII, XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII, and XXIV in the reaction Schemes and discussions that follow are as defined above.	Scheme 1 refers to the preparation of compounds of the formula I from compounds of the formula III. Compounds of the formula III are commercially available or can be made by methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.	Scheme 1 illustrates a method of synthesizing compounds of the formula I, wherein R1 is a group of the formula G1, G3, G4 or G5. Referring to Scheme 1, a compound of the formula III, wherein Q is a suitable leaving group (e.g. chloro, fluoro, bromo, mesylate, tosylate, etc.), is reacted with a compound of the formula R1H, wherein R1 is a group of the formula G1, G3, G4 or G5, in the presence of a base, to form the corresponding compound of formula II. This reaction is generally carried out at a temperature from about 0° C. to about 140° C. for about 1 hour to about 5 days, preferably at about 25° C. for about 3 days, in a polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), preferably DMF. Suitable bases include anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH), as well as amines such as pyrrolidine, triethylamine and pyridine. Anhydrous potassium carbonate is preferred.	Compounds of formula II can be converted into compounds of the formula I by subjecting them to an aldol condensation or a Wittig reaction. For example, in the case of an aldol condensation, a compound of the formula II can be reacted with a compound of the formula	in the presence of a base, to form an aldol intermediate of the formula	which may be isolated or converted directly in the same reaction step to a compound of the formula I, wherein the dashed line is a double bond, by the loss of water. The degree of completion for the conversion of compounds of the formula II to the aldol product of formula I may be assessed using one or more analytical techniques, such as thin layer chromatography (tic) or mass spectrometry. In some instances it may be possible or desirable to isolate the intermediate of formula V. In such case, the compound of formula V may be converted into the compound of formula I by the elimination of water using techniques which are familiar to those skilled in the art, for example, by heating to the reflux temperature a solution of the compound of formula V in a solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene, in the presence of a catalytic amount of benzene- or p-toluene-sulfonic acid with provision for the removal of the water generated. Such water removal techniques may involve the use of molecular sieves or a Dean-Stark trap to isolate the water created as an azeotrope with the solvent. The aldol reaction is typically carried out in a polar solvent such as DMSO, DMF, tetrahydrofuran (THF), methanol or ethanol, at a temperature from about −25° C. to about 80° C. Preferably, this reaction is carried out in THF at about 25° C. Suitable bases for use in the aldol formation step include potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), sodium hydride (NaH), pyrrolidine and piperidine. Sodium hydride is preferred. Aldol condensations are described in “Modern Synthetic Reactions,” Herbert O. House, 2d. Edition, W. A. Benjamin, Menlo Park, Calif., 629-682 (1972).	Alternatively, the compound of formula IV (i.e., a compound of formula IVa wherein “L” is hydrogen) can be converted into a compound of the formula I by means of a Wittig olefination, as described in Helvetica Chimica Acta, 46, 1580 (1963), and depicted below.	The compound of formula IVa can be converted into the corresponding bromide of formula XI using standard bromination conditions, followed by treatment with triphenylphosphine in anhydrous THF to form the intermediate of formula XII. The compound of formula XII can then be treated with a strong base (e.g, aqueous Na2CO3) to generate the corresponding phosphonium ylide, which can then be reacted with the appropriate intermediate of formula II to produce compounds of general formula I. This transformation is described in A. Maeroker, Organic Reactions, 1965, 14, 270.	Compounds of the formula I wherein the dashed line represents a single carbon-carbon bond may be prepared by hydrogenating the corresponding compounds wherein the dashed line represents a double carbon-carbon bond, using standard techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, reduction of the double bond may be effected with hydrogen gas (H2), using catalysts such as palladium on carbon (Pd/C), palladium on barium sulfate (Pd/BaSO4), platinum on carbon (Pt/C), or tris(triphenylphosphine) rhodium chloride (Wilkinson's catalyst), in an appropriate solvent such as methanol, ethanol, THF, dioxane or ethyl acetate, at a pressure from about 1 to about 5 atmospheres and a temperature from about 10° C. to about 60° C., as described in Catalytic Hydrogenation in Organic Synthesis, Paul Rylander, Academic Press Inc., San Diego, 1979, pp. 31-63. The following conditions are preferred: Pd on carbon, methanol at 25° C. and 50 psi of hydrogen gas pressure. This method also provides for introduction of hydrogen isotopes (i.e., deuterium, tritium) by replacing 1H2 with 2H2 or 3H2 in the above procedure.	An alternative procedure employing the use of reagents such as ammonium formate and Pd/C in methanol at the reflux temperature under an inert atmosphere (e.g., nitrogen or argon gas) is also effective in reducing the carbon-carbon double bond of compounds of the formula I. Another alternative method involves selective reduction of the carbon-carbon bond. This can be accomplished using samarium and iodine or samarium iodide (Sml2) in methanol or ethanol at about room temperature, as described by R. Yanada et. al., Synlett., pp 443-4 (1995).	The starting materials of the formulas III and IV are either commercially available or known in the art. For example, compounds of formula III in which R2 is hydrogen are readily available from commercial sources or may be prepared using procedures disclosed in the chemical literature. They may also be prepared from the corresponding carboxylic acids or esters (i.e., formula III) wherein R2=OH or O-alkyl), which are commercially available. These acids or esters can be reduced to the corresponding alcohols of formula XIII, depicted below, wherein Q is defined as for formula III, using one or more of a variety of reducing agents and conditions, depending upon the nature of the substituents Q and X.	Such reducing agents include sodium borohydride (NaBH4), sodium cyanoborohydride (NaCNBH3), lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) and borane in THF (BH3•THF) in solvents such as methanol, ethanol, THF, diethyl ether and dioxane. Oxidation of the alcohol of formula Xil to the corresponding aldehyde of formula II may be accomplished using a selective oxidizing agent such as Jones reagent (hydrogen chromate (H2CrO4)), pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) or manganese dioxide (MnO2). References for such conversions are readily available (e.g., K. B. Wiberg, Oxidation in Organic Chemistry, Part A, Academic Press Inc, N.Y., 69-72 (1965)).	The compounds of formula R1H used in the preparation of intermediates of the formula III are readily available or may be prepared using standard methods of organic synthesis known to those skilled in the art and adapted from procedures disclosed in the chemical literature. For example, the preparation of compounds of the formula R1H, wherein R1 is G1, may be accomplished using the following reaction sequence, beginning with commercially available N-tert-butoxycarbonyl piperazine (VI):	Alkylation of the compound of formula VI with a compound of the formula R6Y wherein Y is a leaving group, and is defined as Q is defined above and R6 is (C1-C6)alkyl, aryl-(C2-C4)alkyl wherein the aryl moiety is phenyl or naphthyl, or heteroaryl-(CH2)q−, wherein q is zero, one, two, three or four, and the heteroaryl moiety is selected from pyridyl, pyrimidyl, benzoxazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzisoxazolyl, and benzisothiazolyl, in the presence of an acid scavenger (e.g., sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) or potassium carbonate (K2CO3)), in a polar solvent such as acetone at a temperature of about 10° C. to about the reflux temperature of the solvent, will yield the intermediate of formula VII. Removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl group can be accomplished using acidic conditions, e.g., HBr in acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid until the reaction is judged to be complete.	Compounds of the formula II wherein R1 is tetrahydropyridine or piperidine and R2 is hydrogen can be prepared from 2-bromobenzaldehyde, which is commercially available, as depicted in Scheme 2. Referring to Scheme 2, the compound of formula III is first converted into a protected aidehyde or ketone of the formula XIV, wherein P represents the entire protected aldehyde or ketone moiety, using methods well known in the art. For example, the 1,3-dioxolane derivative of the aldehyde may be prepared according to the method described by J. E. Cole et al., J. Chem. Soc., 244 (1962), by refluxing a solution of the aldehyde of formula III and 1,3-propanediol in anhydrous benzene with a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid. When R2 of formula III is not hydrogen, the ketone can be protected using an appropriate protecting group. Appropriate protecting groups can be chosen from many such groups based on the presence and nature of the substituent X. Examples of suitable protecting groups may be found in T. W. Greene, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1981. The most preferred protecting groups are those that are resistant to catalytic hydrogenation (e.g., 1, 3-dioxolane), which would therefore allow for the subsequent reduction, if required, of the carbon-carbon double bond of the tetrahydropyridines of formula XVIA.	Compounds of the formula XIV can then be treated with vinylstannanes of the formula	(1-BOC-4-trimethylstannyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine) (wherein BOC refers to tertbutyloxycarbonyl), in the presence of a catalyst, to form the corresponding compound of formula XVIA. Palladium is the preferred catalyst (for example, (C6H5)3P)4Pd or Pd2(dba)3), wherein dba refers to dibenzylideneacetone. This reaction may be carried out as described in “Palladium-catalyzed Vinylation of Organic Halides” in Organic Reactions, 27, 345-390, W. G. Dauben, Ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., (1982).	Compounds of formula II where R1 is piperidine (G2) can be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of the tetrahydropyridine of formula XVIA from the previous paragraph using standard methods known in the art, generally using palladium on carbon as the catalyst, to form the corresponding compounds of formula XVIB. This reaction is typically performed in an inert solvent, such as ethanol or ethyl acetate, either with or without a protic acid such as acetic acid or hydrochloric acid (HCl). Acetic acid is preferred. The protecting groups on G2 (e.g, BOC) can be removed using one or more of the techniques described in Greene, referred to above, for example, stirring the compound of formula XVI in ethyl acetate and 3 molar hydrochloric acid at about room temperature for about 30 minutes. The protecting group for the aldehyde or ketone, P, can be converted into the unprotected ketone or aldehyde of the formula −C(═O)R2 using one or more of the techniques described in Greene, for example, stirring a solution of the compound of formula XVI in THF and 5% hydrochloric acid at room temperature for 20 hours.	Compounds of the formula XIV from the previous reaction scheme may also be treated with alkyllithium reagents, for example butyllithium, sec-butyllithium or tertbutyllithium, preferably butyllithium in an inert solvent, as shown in Scheme 3, to form the intermediate lithium anion of formula XVII. Suitable solvents for this reaction include, for example, ether or tetrahydrofuran, preferably tetrahydrofuran. Reaction temperatures can range from about −110° C. to about 0° C. The intermediate lithium anions of formula XVII can then be further reacted with a suitable electrophile, selection of which depends on the presence and nature of the substituent. Suitable electrophiles for use in preparing compounds of the formula II wherein R1 is a group of the formula G2 include, for example, carbonyl derivatives or alkylating agents (e.g., 1-BOC-4-piperidone). In the case where an aldehyde or ketone is used as the electrophile, the hydroxy group must be removed from the intermediate of formula XVIII, as depicted below, in order to form the corresponding compound of formula II.	This step may be accomplished by one of several standard methods known in the art.	For example, a thiocarbonyl derivative such as a xanthate may be prepared and removed by free radical processes, both of which are known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the hydroxyl group may be removed by reduction with a hydride source such as triethysilane under acidic conditions, using, for example, trifluoroacetic acid or boron trifluoride. The reduction reaction can be performed neat or in a solvent such as methylene chloride. A further alternative would be to first convert the hydroxyl group to a suitable leaving group, such as tosylate or chloride, using standard methods known in the art, and then to remove the leaving group with a nucleophilic hydride, such as, for example, lithium aluminum hydride. The latter reaction is typically performed in an inert solvent such as ether or tetrahydrofuran. Also, a reducing agent may be used to reductively remove the benzylic substituent. Suitable reducing agents include, for example, Raney nickel in ethanol and sodium or lithium in liquid ammonia.	Another alternative method for removing the hydroxyl group is to first dehydrate the alcohol of formula XVIII to an olefin, of formula XVIA (i.e. see Scheme 2), with a reagent such as Burgess salt (J. Org. Chem., 38, 26 (1973)) and then to catalytically hydrogenate the double bond under standard conditions with a catalyst such as palladium on carbon. The alcohol may also be dehydrated to the olefin by treatment with acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid.	Compounds of the formula II, wherein R1 is G2 and R6 is hydrogen, can be converted into the corresponding compounds of the formula II wherein R1 is G2 and R6 is other than hydrogen, by reacting them with a compound of the formula R6Y, as described above for preparing compounds of the formula VII.	Compounds of formula I, wherein R6 is other than hydrogen, can also be prepared from compounds of the formula XX, according to the methods of Scheme 4. Compounds of the formula XX are commercially available or can be made by methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Referring to Scheme 4, a compound of the formula XX is converted to a compound of the formula XXI by reaction with a compound of the formula R1H, wherein R1 is G1, G3, G4 or G5, in the presence of a base. This reaction is generally carried out at a temperature from about 0° C. to about 140° C. for about 1 hour to about 5 days, preferably at about 25° C. for about 3 days, in a polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), preferably DMF. Suitable bases include anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH), as well as amines such as pyrrolidine, triethylamine and pyridine. Anhydrous potassium carbonate is preferred.	Compounds of the formula XXI are reduced to compounds of the formula XXII in the presence of a reducing agent in a reaction insert solvent. Suitable reducing agents include using hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst, such as palladium on carbon, Raney Nickel and the like. Suitable reaction inert solvents include methanol, ethanol or ethyl acetate. The aforesaid reaction may be performed at an initial pressure of from about one to about four atmospheres and at a temperature of about 0° C. to about 60° C. Typically, the reaction is conducted with methanol as the solvent and with about three atomospheres of hydrogen gas pressure at room temperature for about 0.5 to 1.0 hrs.	Compounds of the formula XXII are converted into compounds of the formula I via a diazonium intermediate of the formula XXIII. This conversion, a so called Heck reaction, can be accomplished as described in several references, including, for example, those by Sengupta and Bhattacharyya in Tetrahedron Letters, 36 (25), 4475-4478 (1995), and by Kikukawa et al. in Chemistry Letters, 551-552 (1980). Specifically, an amino compound of the formula XXII may be treated with a diazotizing reagent such as NaNO2, or an alkyl nitrite such as tert-butyl nitrite, which is capable of transforming the amino compound of XXII to a diazonium salt of the formula XXIII. The diazonium salt may be isolated, but more conveniently it is prepared in situ and then treated with an acrylamide of formula	in the presence of a catalytic amount of a palladium complex such as palladium (II) acetate or bis(dibenzylideneacetone)palladium (0), palladium (II) acetate being preferred. The reaction is carried out in an inert solvert such as methanol, ethanol or acetic acid at a temperature of about 0° C. to about the reflux temperature of the solvent used and at atmospheric pressure for a period of about 15 minutes to about 4 days.	The compounds of formula XXIV are readily prepared from commercially available starting materials by methods and procedures disclosed in the scientific literature. For example, reaction of an acid chloride of formula R2—CH═CR5-COCl with an amine of the general formula HNR3R4 in an inert solvent such as chloroform, methylene chloride, THF or diethyl ether and in the presence of an acid scavenger such as triethylamine or pyridine are generally useful for the preparation of the amide intermediate.	Compounds of the formula I, wherein the dashed line is a double bond, can be reduced to form a compound of formula I, wherein the dashed line represents a single bond by the methods described in Scheme 1.	Unless indicated otherwise, the pressure of each of the above reactions is not critical. Generally, the reactions will be conducted at a pressure of about one to about three atmospheres, preferably at ambient pressure (about one atmosphere).	The compounds of the formula I which are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate a compound of the formula I from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent, and subsequently convert the free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is obtained.	The acids which are used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are those which form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate or bisulfate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate or acid citrate, tartrate or bitartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate and pamoate [i.e., 1,1′-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)] salts.	Those compounds of the formula I which are also acidic in nature, e.g., where R3 includes a COOH or tetrazole moiety, are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the herein described acidic compounds of formula I. These non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum product yields.	Compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts (hereinafter also referred to, collectively, as “the active compounds”) are useful psychotherapeutics and are potent agonists and/or antagonists of the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) and/or serotonin 1D (5-HT1D) receptors. The active compounds are useful in the treatment of hypertension, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, phobias (e.g., agoraphobia, social phobia and simple phobias), posttraumatic stress syndrome, avoidant personality disorder, sexual dysfunction (e.g., premature ejaculation), eating disorders (e.g., anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa), obesity, chemical dependencies (e.g., addictions to alcohol, cocaine, heroin, phenolbarbitol, nicotine and benzodiazepines), cluster headache, migraine, pain, Alzheimer's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, memory disorders (e.g., dementia, amnestic disorders, and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD)), Parkinson's diseases (e.g., dementia in Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesias), endocrine disorders (e.g., hyperprolactinaemia), vasospasm (particularly in the cerebral vasculature), cerebellar ataxia, gastrointestinal tract disorders involving changes in motility and secretion, and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and headache associated with vascular disorders. These compounds are also useful as vasodilators.	The affinities of the compounds of this invention for the various serotonin-1 receptors can be determined using standard radioligand binding assays as described in the literature. The 5-HT1A affinity can be measured using the procedure of Hoyer et al. (Brain Res., 1986, 376, 85). The 5-HT1D affinity can be measured using the procedure of Heuring and Peroutka (J. Neurosci., 1987, 7, 894).	The in vitro activity of the compounds of the present invention at the 5-HT1D binding site may be determined according to the following procedure. Bovine caudate tissue is homogenized and suspended in 20 volumes of a buffer containing 50 mM TRIS•hydrochloride (tris[hydroxymethy]aminomethane hydrochloride) at a pH of 7.7. The homogenate is then centrifuged at 45,000 G for 10 minutes. The supernatant is then discarded and the resulting pellet resuspended in approximately 20 volumes of 50 mM TRIS•hydrochloride (HCl) buffer at pH 7.7. This suspension is then pre-incubated for 15 minutes at 37° C., after which the suspension is centrifuged again at 45,000 G for 10 minutes and the supernatant discarded. The resulting pellet (approximately 1 gram) is resuspended in 150 ml of a buffer of 15 mM TRIS•hydrochloride (HCl) containing 0.01 percent ascorbic acid with a final pH of 7.7 and also containing 10 μM pargyline and 4 mM calcium chloride (CaCl2). The suspension is kept on ice at least 30 minutes prior to use.	The inhibitor, control or vehicle is then incubated according to the following procedure. To 50 μl of a 20 percent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/80 percent distilled water solution is added 200 μl of tritiated 5-hydroxytryptamine (2 nM) in a buffer of 50 mM TRIS•hydrochloride containing 0.01 percent ascorbic acid at pH 7.7 and also containing 10 μM pargyline and 4 μM calcium chloride, plus 100 nM of 8-hydroxy-DPAT (dipropylaminotetraline) and 100 nM of mesulergine. To this mixture is added 750 μl of bovine caudate tissue, and the resulting suspension is vortexed to ensure a homogenous suspension. The suspension is then incubated in a shaking water bath for 30 minutes at 25° C. After incubation is complete, the suspension is filtered using glass fiber filters (e.g., Whatman GF/B-filters™). The pellet is then washed three times with 4 ml of a buffer of 50 mM TRIS•hydrochloride at pH 7.7. The pellet is then placed in a scintillation vial with 5 ml of scintillation fluid (aquasol 2™) and allowed to sit overnight. The percent inhibition can be calculated for each dose of the compound. An IC50 value can then be calculated from the percent inhibition values.	The activity of the compounds of the present invention for 5-HT1A binding ability can be determined according to the following procedure. Rat brain cortex tissue is homogenized and divided into samples of 1 gram lots and diluted with 10 volumes of 0.32 M sucrose solution. The suspension is then centrifuged at 900 G for 10 minutes and the supemate separated and recentrifuged at 70,000 G for 15 minutes. The supernate is discarded and the pellet re-suspended in 10 volumes of 15 mM TRIS•hydrochloride at pH 7.5. The suspension is allowed to incubate for 15 minutes at 37° C. After pre-incubation is complete, the suspension is centrifuged at 70,000 G for 15 minutes and the supernate discarded. The resulting tissue pellet is resuspended in a buffer of 50 mM TRIS•hydrochloride at pH 7.7 containing 4 mM of calcium chloride and 0.01 percent ascorbic acid. The tissue is stored at −70° C. until ready for an experiment. The tissue can be thawed immediately prior to use, diluted with 10 μm pargyline and kept on ice.	The tissue is then incubated according to the following procedure. Fifty microliters of control, inhibitor, or vehicle (1 percent DMSO final concentration) is prepared at various dosages. To this solution is added 200 μl of tritiated DPAT at a concentration of 1.5 nM in a buffer of 50 mM TRIS•hydrochloride at pH 7.7 containing 4 mM calcium chloride, 0.01 percent ascorbic acid and pargyline. To this solution is then added 750 μl of tissue and the resulting suspension is vortexed to ensure homogeneity. The suspension is then incubated in a shaking water bath for 30 minutes at 37° C. The solution is then filtered, washed twice with 4 ml of 10 mM TRIS•hydrochloride at pH 7.5 containing 154 mM of sodium chloride. The percent inhibition is calculated for each dose of the compound, control or vehicle. IC50 values are calculated from the percent inhibition values.	The compounds of formula I of the present invention described in the following Examples were assayed for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D affinity using the aforementioned procedures. All such compounds exhibited IC50's less than 0.60 μM for 5-HT1D affinity and IC50's less than 1.0 μM for 5-HT1A affinity.	The agonist and antagonist activities of the compounds of the invention at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D receptors can be determined using a single saturating concentration according to the following procedure. Male Hartley guinea pigs are decapitated and 5-HT1A receptors are dissected out of the hippocampus, while 5-HT1D receptors are obtained by slicing at 350 mm on a Mcllwain tissue chopper and dissecting out the substantia nigra from the appropriate slices. The individual tissues are homogenized in 5 mM HEPES buffer containing 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.5) using a hand-held glass-Teflon® homogenizer and centrifuged at 35,000×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The pellets are resuspended in 100 mM HEPES buffer containing 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.5) to a final protein concentration of 20 mg (hippocampus) or 5 mg (substantia nigra) of protein per tube. The following agents are added so that the reaction mix in each tube contain 2.0 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ATP, 1.0 mM cAMP, 0.5 mM IBMX, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 0.31 mg/mL creatine phosphokinase, 100 μM GTP and 0.5-1 microcuries of [32P]-ATP (30 Ci/mmol: NEG-003—New England Nuclear). Incubation is initiated by the addition of tissue to siliconized microfuge tubes (in triplicate) at 30° C. for 15 minutes. Each tube receives 20 μL tissue, 10 μL drug or buffer (at 10×final concentration), 10 μL 32 nM agonist or buffer (at 10×final concentration), 20 μL forskolin (3 μM final concentration) and 40 μL of the preceding reaction mix. Incubation is terminated by the addition of 100 μL 2% SDS, 1.3 mM cAMP, 45 mM ATP solution containing 40,000 dpm [3H]-cAMP (30 Ci/mmol: NET-275—New England Nuclear) to monitor the recovery of cAMP from the columns. The separation of [32P]-ATP and [32P]-cAMP is accomplished using the method of Salomon et al., Analytical Biochemistry, 1974, 58, 541-548. Radioactivity is quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Maximal inhibition is defined by 10 μM (R)-8-OH-DPAT for 5-HT1A receptors, and 320 nM 5-HT for 5HT1D receptors. Percent inhibitions by the test compounds are then calculated in relation to the inhibitory effect of (R)-8-OH-DPAT for 5-HT1A receptors or 5-HT for 5-HT1D receptors. The reversal of agonist induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity is calculated in relation to the 32 nM agonist effect.	The compounds of the invention can be tested for in vivo activity for antagonism of 5-HT1D agonist-induced hypothermia in guinea pigs according to the following procedure.	
US6258953_0005	Male Hartley guinea pigs from Charles River, weighing 250-275 grams on arrival and 300-600 grams at testing, serve as subjects in the experiment. The guinea pigs are housed under standard laboratory conditions on a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. lighting schedule for at least seven days prior to experimentation. Food and water are available ad libitum until the time of testing.	The compounds of the invention can be administered as solutions in a volume of 1 ml/kg. The vehicle used is varied depending on compound solubility. Test compounds are typically administered either sixty minutes orally (p.o.) or 0 minutes subcutaneously (s.c.) prior to the 5-HT1D agonist, which is administered at a dose of 5.6 mg/kg, s.c. Before a first temperature reading is taken, each guinea pig is placed in a clear plastic shoe box containing wood chips and a metal grid floor and allowed to acclimate to the surroundings for 30 minutes. Animals are then returned to the same shoe box after each temperature reading. Prior to each temperature measurement each animal is firmly held with one hand for a 30-second period. A digital thermometer with a small animal probe is used for temperature measurements. The probe is made of semi-flexible nylon with an epoxy tip. The temperature probe is inserted 6 cm. into the rectum and held there for 30 seconds or until a stable recording is obtained. Temperatures are then recorded.	In p.o. screening experiments, a “pre-drug” baseline temperature reading is made at −90 minutes, the test compound is given at −60 minutes and an additional −30 minute reading is taken. The 5-HT1D agonist is then administered at 0 minutes and temperatures are taken 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes later.	In subcutaneous screening experiments, a pre-drug baseline temperature reading is made at −30 minutes. The test compound and 5-HT1D agonists are given concurrently and temperatures are taken at 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes later.	Data are analyzed with two-way analysis of variants with repeated measures in Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis.	The active compounds of the invention can be evaluated as anti-migraine agents by testing the extent to which they mimic sumatriptan in contracting the dog isolated saphenous vein strip [P. P. A. Humphrey et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 94,1128 (1988)]. This effect can be blocked by methiothepin, a known serotonin antagonist. Sumatriptan is known to be useful in the treatment of migraine and produces a selective increase in carotid vascular resistance in the anesthetized dog. The pharnacological basis of sumatriptan efficacy has been discussed in W. Fenwick et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 96, 83 (1989).	The serotonin 5-HT1 agonist activity can be determined by the in vitro receptor binding assays, as described for the 5-HT1A receptor using rat cortex as the receptor source and [3H]-8-OH-DPAT as the radioligand [D. Hoyer et al. Eur. J. Pharm., 118, 13 (1 985)] and as described for the 5-HT1D receptor using bovine caudate as the receptor source and [3H]serotonin as the radioligand [R. E. Heuring and S. J. Peroutka, J. Neuroscience, 7, 894 (1987)]. Of the active compounds tested, all exhibited an IC50 in either assay of 1 μM or less.	The compounds of formula I may advantageously be used in conjunction with one or more other therapeutic agents, for instance, different antidepressant agents such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, dothiepin, doxepin, trimipramine, butripyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, iprindole, lofepramine, nortriptyline or protriptyline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine or tranylcyclopramine) or 5-HT re-uptake inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, sertraline, fluoxetine or paroxetine), and/or with antiparkinsonian agents such as dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents (e.g., levodopa, preferably in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor e.g., benserazide or carbidopa, or with a dopamine agonist e.g., bromocriptine, lysuride or pergolide). It is to be understood that the present invention covers the use of a compound of general formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents.	Compounds of the formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in combination with a 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor (e.g., fluvoxamine, sertraline, fluoxetine or paroxetine), preferably sertraline, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or polymorph thereof (the combination of a compound of formula I with a 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor is referred herein to as “the active combination”), are useful psychotherapeutics and may be used in the treatment or prevention of disorders the treatment or prevention of which is facilitated by enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission (e.g., hypertension, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, posttraumatic stress syndrome, avoidant personality disorder, sexual dysfunction, eating disorders, obesity, chemical dependencies, cluster headache, migraine, pain, Alzheimer's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, memory disorders (e.g., dementia, amnestic disorders, and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD)), Parkinson's diseases (e.g., dementia in Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic-induced Parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesias), endocrine disorders (e.g., hyperprolactinaemia), vasospasm (particularly in the cerebral vasculature), cerebellar ataxia, gastrointestinal tract disorders involving changes in motility and secretion and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and headache associated with vascular disorders.	Serotonin (5-HT) re-uptake inhibitors, preferably sertraline, exhibit positive activity against depression; chemical dependencies; anxiety disorders including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, simple phobias, social phobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder; obsessive-compulsive disorder; avoidant personality disorder and premature ejaculation in mammals, including humans, due in part to their ability to block the synaptosomal uptake of serotonin.	U.S. Pat. No. 4,536,518 describes the synthesis, pharmaceutical composition and use of sertraline for depression and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.	Activity of the active combination as antidepressants and related pharmacological properties can be determined by methods (1)-(4) below, which are described in Koe, B. et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 226 (3), 686-700 (1983). Specifically, activity can be determined by studying (1) their ability to affect the efforts of mice to escape from a swim-tank (Porsolt mouse “behavior despair” test), (2) their ability to potentiate 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced behavioral symptoms in mice in vivo, (3) their ability to antagonize the serotonin-depleting activity of p-chloroamphetamine hydrochloride in rat brain in vivo, and (4) their ability to block the uptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine by synaptosomal rat brain cells in vitro. The ability of the active combination to counteract reserpine hypothermia in mice in vivo can be determined according to the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,029,731.	The compositions of the present invention may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Thus, the active compounds of the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, intranasal, parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous) or rectal administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.	For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Uquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).	For buccal administration, the composition may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.	The active compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, including using conventional catheterization techniques or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulating agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.	The active compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.	For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the active compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of a solution or suspension from a pump spray container that is squeezed or pumped by the patient or as an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount.

In connection with the use of an active compound of this invention with a 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor, preferably sertraline, for the treatment of subjects possessing any of the above conditions, it is to be noted that these compounds may be administered either alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers by either of the routes previously indicated, and that such administration can be carried out in both single and multiple dosages. More particularly, the active combination can be administered in a wide variety of different dosage forms, i.e., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically-acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays, aqueous suspension, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc. Moreover, such oral pharmaceutical formulations can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored by means of various agents of the type commonly employed for such purposes.

US6323216_0003	Novel basic derivatives of benz[e]isoindol-1-ones and pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinolin-1-ones which can be represented by the general formula (I) indicated below are described:	in which	X is CH or N,	R is H, Cl or OR1 in which R1 is H or an alkyl group having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms,	Het is the 3-endotropyl group (that is, the 8-methyl-8-azadicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl group) or the 3-quinuclidyl group (that is, the 1-azadicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl group); these compounds have been found to be potent and selective antagonists of the 5-HT3 serotonin-like receptor and can therefore be used, for example, as anti-emetics as well as in various pathological conditions of the central nervous system, and as antitussives.	The subject of the present invention novel basic derivatives of benz[e]isoindol-1-ones and pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinolin-1-ones which can be represented by the general formula (I) indicated below:	and in which	X is CH or N,	r is H, Cl or OR1 in which R1 is H or an alkyl group having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms,	Het is the 3-endotropyl group (that is, the 8-methyl-8-azadicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl group) or the 3-quinuclidyl group (that is, the 1-azadicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl group).	The compounds of the present invention have been found to be potent and selective antagonists of the 5-HT3 serotoninergic receptor and can therefore advantageously be used in the treatment of various diseases in man, for example, as anti-emetics, particularly for vomiting associated with antitumoral chemotherapy, and in various pathological conditions of the central nervous system such as, for example, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, psychosis, Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia, and also as antitussives. Since serotonin is also known to be involved in the regulation of the peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract, the compounds of the invention can also advantageously be used as prokinetic agents in various pathological conditions connected with hypomotility of the gastrointestinal tract such as, for example, non-ulcerous dyspepsia, reflux oesophagitis and in irritable bowel syndrome.	In addition to the compounds currently used in treatment as anti-emetics, such as Granisetron and Ondasetron, many publications and patents describe novel compounds with 5-HT3 antagonistic activity. Thus, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,200,413 describes N-azadicyclo-indol-1-carboxyamides with 5-HT-anatagonistic activity; U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,303 describes azacyclo-imidazopyridines with 5-HT3-antagonistic activity, U.S. Pat. No. 5,280,028 describes benzimidazole derivatives active as 5-HT3-antagonists and 5-HT4-antagonists, U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,562 describes indolone derivatives substituted with groups such as endotropyl and quinuclidyl groups. Recently, tropyl-azaindole derivatives with mixed 5-HT3- and sigma-oppioid-antagonist activity having antitussive activity (WO 04742-A-1995), 1-heteroaryl-4-alkyl-4-aminopiperidine derivatives which easily overcome the blood-brain barrier [EP-647639-A (1995)], tetrahydrobenzimidazole derivatives with mixed anti-5-HT3 and H3 histamine activity [WO 9509168-A(1995)] and imidazol-4-yl-piperidine derivatives with mixed anti-5-HT3 and -5-HT4 activity (EP-646583-A(1995)] have also been described. All of this research shows that there is a great therapeutic need to find novel, ever more potent, selective and better tolerated drugs with 5-HT3-antagonistic activity. In accordance with this need, the object of the present invention is to provide novel drug treatments having potent and selective 5-HT3-antagonistic activity for the treatment of all pathological conditions, both central and peripheral, which are due to poor operation of the 5-HT3 serotoninergic receptor system. Pharmaceutical forms of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by conventional techniques, for example, as tablets, capsules, suspensions, solutions, suppositories or patches, and may be administered orally, parenterally, rectally or transdermally, or as other forms suitable for achieving the therapeutic effect such as, for example, solid preparations for oral use with protracted action which permit controlled release of the active substance over time.	The active ingredient is normally administered to the patient with a reference dose variable from 0.001 to 1 mg/kg of body weight per dose. For parenteral administration, the use of a water-soluble salt of the compounds of the invention, such as the hydrochloride or another non-toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable salt, is preferable. As inactive ingredients, substances commonly used in pharmaceutical technology such as excipients, binders, flavourings, disaggregants, colourings, humectants, etc. may be used.	The method of preparing the derivatives of the invention consists of a series of reactions which comprise:	a) reacting esters of formula (IV)	 prepared as described by Mayer et al (Berichte 1922, 55, 1835-1861), in which X and R have the meanings given above and R′ may be methyl or ethyl, with N-bromosuccinimide in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, in an organic solvent such as, for example, carbon tetrachloride, at a temperature between ambient temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent, for a period of between 1 and 8 h, to give the corresponding 2-bromomethyl derivatives of formula III (see Synthesis scheme 1, step 1);	b) reacting the bromo derivatives of formula III	 with a stoichiometric quantity of a heterocyclic amine of formula (II)	NH2-Het  (II)	 in which Het is the 3-endotropyl group, that is, the 8-methyl-8-azadicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl group, in the presence of an inert tertiary base which functions as a proton acceptor, or with an excess of the amine (II), at the reflux temperature of an anhydrous solvent, preferably toluene, for a period of between 1 and 24 h, to give the corresponding amide derivatives of formula (I) in accordance with Synthesis scheme 1, step 2. The compounds of formula (I) in which R is OH are prepared by hot acid hydrolysis of the corresponding ethereal derivatives.	Synthesis Scheme 1	Step 1	Step 2	in which Het is the 3-endotropyl (8-CH3-8-azadicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl) group	The method for the preparation of the derivatives of the invention in which Het is the 3-quinuclidyl group (that is, the 1-azadicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl group) consists of a series of reactions illustrated by Synthesis scheme 2, comprising: protecting the tertiary endocyclic nitrogen of the 3-aminoquinuclidine by alkylation with allyl bromide, reacting the non-isolated quaternized intermediate (VI) with the appropriate bromine derivative of formula (III) indicated in Scheme 1, to give the quaternary ammoniacal salt of the cyclized compound (V) which, in turn, is not isolated, and deprotecting hot with n-dipropylamine in dimethyl formamide in the presence of a catalytic quantity of Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 to give amide derivatives of formula (I) according to Synthesis scheme 2, step 3, in which Het is the 3-quinuclidyl group and X and R have the meanings given above.	Synthesis scheme 2	Step 1	Step 2	Step 3	in which Het is the 3-quinuclidyl group (that is, the 1-azadicyclo[2.2.2.]oct-3-yl group).	The following examples are given below to illustrate the invention further.

(Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989, 38, 1693-95) was followed with slight modifications. Rat cortex and hippocampus were used to produce a pellet having a final concentration of 20 mg of tissue/sample. Specific activity of the tracer: 81 Ci/mmole; incubation time: 30 min; incubation temperature: 25° C. Specific binding: 70% of the total; Kd=0.6×10−9M.	b) Affinity For the Serotonin Uptake Site	The method of Plenge et al (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1990, 189, 129-134) was followed with slight modifications. The entire rat brain was used to produce a pellet having a final concentration of 2 mg of tissue/sample. Specific activity of the tracer: 29.7 Ci/mmole; incubation time: 60 min.; incubation temperature: 25° C. Specific binding: 75% of the total; Kd=0.09×10−9M.	c) Affinity For the 5-HT2 Receptors	The method of Leysen et al (Mol. Pharmacol. 1982, 21, 301-314) was followed with slight modifications. Rat prefrontal cortex was used to produce a pellet having a final concentration of 8 mg of tisssue/sample. Specific activity of the tracer: 80.9 Ci/mmole; incubation time: 20 min; incubation temperature: 37° C. Specific binding: 90% of the total; Kd=0.5×10−9M.	d) Affinity For the 5-HT1A Receptors	The method of Hall et al (J. Neurochem. 1985, 44, 1685-1696) was followed with slight modifications. Rat hippocampus was used to produce a pellet having a final concentration of 4 mg of tissue/sample. Specific activity of the tracer: 137 Ci/mmole; incubation time 10 min; incubation temperature: 37° C. Specific binding: 80% of the total; Kd=2.3×10−9M.	It can be seen from the data given in Table 2 that many of the compounds of the invention are potent antagonists of the 5-HT3 subtype receptor. For example Compound 7 has a sub-nanomolar affinity for the 5-HT3 receptor and was the most active of all of the compounds tested. The compounds of the invention were also shown to possess a high selectivity for this receptor since they were very slightly active or inactive at the other receptor subtypes tested. It is also interesting to note that even small structural variations of the compounds of the invention cause a significant loss of affinity for the 5HT3 receptor. Thus, for example, Compound 10, that is, the analogous 3-hexotropyl derivative of the corresponding 3-endotropyl (Compound 1), described herein purely for comparative purposes, was almost 2 orders of logarithmic magnitude less active than Compound 1; similarly, Compound 11 which is also given for comparative purposes, that is endo-2-[8-methyl-8-azadicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl]-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinolin-1-one, which has a “linear” polycyclic fusion and which is the pyrrolo-quinoline analogue of Compound 2 was approximately 60 times less active than the latter, in which the polycyclic fusion takes place on the “e” face and is hence angular.	Activity in vivo	The potent 5-HT3-antagonistic activity performed by the compounds of the invention in vitro was confirmed in vivo in the rat in the bradycardial reflex test according to Bezold-Jarisch (Paintal, Physio. Rev. 1973, 53, 159). Serotonin injected i.v. induced a bradycardial effect in the rat. Products 1-9 of the invention, injected in doses of 0.1 mg/kg i.v. 5 minutes before the administration i.v. of 0.03 mg/kg of serotonin completely blocked the bradycardial effect induced thereby. It should be noted that the same compounds injected alone, even in doses 10 times higher, did not induce any variation in cardiac frequency in the rat, thus behaving as pure antagonists.

Such compounds may be used in pharmaceutical compositions and methods for the treatment of disease states, disorders, and conditions mediated by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity. Thus, the compounds may be administered to treat, e.g., anxiety, pain, inflammation, sleep disorders, eating disorders, or movement disorders (such as multiple sclerosis).	This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/696,166, filed 30 Jun. 2005.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION	The present invention relates to certain N-heteroarylpiperazinyl urea compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and methods of using them for the treatment of disease states, disorders, and conditions mediated by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	Medicinal benefits have been attributed to the cannabis plant for centuries. The primary bioactive constituent of cannabis is Δ9-tetrahydro-cannabinol (THC). The discovery of THC eventually led to the identification of two endogenous cannabinoid receptors responsible for its pharmacological actions, namely CB1 and CB2 (Goya, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 2000, 10, 1529). These discoveries not only established the site of action of THC, but also inspired inquiries into the endogenous agonists of these receptors, or “endocannabinoids”. The first endocannabinoid identified was the fatty acid amide anandamide (AEA). AEA itself elicits many of the pharmacological effects of exogenous cannabinoids (Piomelli, Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003, 4(11), 873).	The catabolism of AEA is primarily attributable to the integral membrane bound protein fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which hydrolyzes AEA to arachidonic acid. FAAH was characterized in 1996 by Cravatt and co-workers (Cravatt, Nature 1996, 384, 83). It was subsequently determined that FAAH is additionally responsible for the catabolism of a large number of important lipid signaling fatty acid amides including: another major endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) (Science 1992, 258, 1946-1949); the sleep-inducing substance, oleamide (OEA) (Science 1995, 268, 1506); the appetite-suppressing agent, N-oleoylethanolamine (Rodriguez de Fonesca, Nature 2001, 414, 209); and the anti-inflammatory agent, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) (Lambert, Curr. Med. Chem. 2002, 9(6), 663).	Small-molecule inhibitors of FAAH should elevate the concentrations of these endogenous signaling lipids and thereby produce their associated beneficial pharmacological effects. There have been some reports of the effects of various FAAH inhibitors in pre-clinical models.	Two carbamate-based inhibitors of FAAH were reported to have analgesic properties in animal models. In rats, BMS-1 (see WO 02/087569), which has the structure shown below, was reported to have an analgesic effect in the Chung spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain, and the Hargraves test of acute thermal nociception. URB-597 was reported to have efficacy in the zero plus maze model of anxiety in rats, as well as analgesic efficacy in the rat hot plate and formalin tests (Kathuria, Nat. Med. 2003, 9(1), 76). The sulfonylfluoride AM374 was also shown to significantly reduce spasticity in chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (CREAE) mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis (Baker, FASEB J. 2001, 15(2), 300).	In addition, the oxazolopyridine ketone OL-135 is reported to be a potent inhibitor of FAAH, and has been reported to have analgesic activity in both the hot plate and tail emersion tests of thermal nociception in rats (WO 04/033652).	Results of research on the effects of certain exogenous cannabinoids has elucidated that a FAAH inhibitor may be useful for treating various conditions, diseases, disorders, or symptoms. These include pain, nausea/emesis, anorexia, spasticity, movement disorders, epilepsy and glaucoma. To date, approved therapeutic uses for cannabinoids include the relief of chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis among patients with cancer and appetite enhancement in patients with HIV/AIDs who experience anorexia as a result of wasting syndrome. Two products are commercially available in some countries for these indications, namely, dronabinol (Marinol®) and nabilone.	Apart from the approved indications, a therapeutic field that has received much attention for cannabinoid use is analgesia, i.e., the treatment of pain. Five small randomized controlled trials showed that THC is superior to placebo, producing dose-related analgesia (Robson, Br. J. Psychiatry 2001, 178, 107-115). Atlantic Pharmaceuticals is developing a synthetic cannabinoid, CT-3, a 1,1-dimethyl heptyl derivative of the carboxylic metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol, as an orally active analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. A pilot phase II trial in chronic neuropathic pain was initiated with CT-3 in Germany in May 2002.	Many individuals with multiple sclerosis have claimed a benefit from cannabis for both disease-related pain and spasticity, with support from small controlled trials (Svendsen, Br. Med. J. 2004, 329, 253). Likewise, victims of spinal cord injuries, such as paraplegia, have reported for years that their painful spasms are alleviated after smoking marijuana. Recently, a report showing that cannabinoids appear to control spasticity and tremor in the CREAE model of multiple sclerosis demonstrated that these effects are mediated by CB1 and CB2 receptors (Baker, Nature 2000, 404, 84-87). Phase 3 clinical trials are currently underway in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury patients with a narrow ratio mixture of tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD).	Small-scale controlled trials have been conducted to investigate other potential commercial uses of cannabinoids. Trials in volunteers confirmed that oral, injected and smoked cannabinoids produced dose-related reductions in intraocular pressure (IOP) and therefore may relieve glaucoma symptoms. Ophthalmologists have prescribed cannabis for patients with glaucoma in whom other drugs have failed to adequately control intraocular pressure (Robson, 2001).	Inhibition of FAAH using a small-molecule inhibitor may be advantageous compared to treatment with a direct-acting CB1 agonist. Administration of exogenous CB1 agonists may produce a range of responses, including reduced nociception, catalepsy, hypothermia, and increased feeding behavior. These four in particular are termed the “cannabinoid tetrad.” Experiments with FAAH −/− mice show reduced responses in tests of nociception, but did not show catalepsy, hypothermia, or increased feeding behavior (Cravatt, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2001, 98(16), 9371). Fasting caused levels of AEA to increase in rat limbic forebrain, but not in other brain areas, providing evidence that stimulation of AEA biosynthesis may be anatomically regionalized to targeted CNS pathways (Kirkham, Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002, 136, 550). The finding that AEA increases are localized within the brain, rather than systemic, suggests that FAAH inhibition with a small molecule could enhance the actions of AEA and other fatty acid amides in tissue regions where synthesis and release of these signaling molecules is occurring in a given pathophysiological condition (Piomelli, 2003).	In addition to the effects of a FAAH inhibitor on AEA and other endocannabinoids, inhibitors of FAAH's catabolism of other lipid mediators may be used in treating other therapeutic indications. For example, PEA has demonstrated biological effects in animal models of inflammation, immunosuppression, analgesia, and neuroprotection (Ueda, J. Biol. Chem. 2001, 276(38), 35552). Oleamide, another substrate of FAAH, induces sleep (Boger, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2000, 97(10), 5044; Mendelson, Neuropsychopharmacology 2001, 25, S36).	Thus, there is evidence that small-molecule FAAH inhibitors may be useful in treating pain of various etiologies, anxiety, multiple sclerosis and other movement disorders, nausea/emesis, eating disorders, epilepsy, glaucoma, inflammation, immunosuppression, neuroprotection, and sleep disorders, and potentially with fewer side effects than treatment with an exogenous cannabinoid. Various small-molecule FAAH modulators have been reported, e.g., in WO 04/033652, U.S. Pat. No. 6,462,054, U.S. Pat. No. 6,096,784, WO 99/26584, WO 97/49667, and WO 96/09817. There remains a need, however, for potent FMH modulators with desirable pharmaceutical properties.	Certain piperazinyl or piperidinyl derivatives have been disclosed in the literature for different uses. For example, JP 11139969 describes certain phenol derivatives as antioxidants and ACAT inhibitors; WO 96/21648 discloses various piperazine derivatives as antitumor agents; JP 48010160 describes certain piperazine derivatives as anti-inflammatory agents; WO 04/072025 discloses certain substituted N-arylheterocycles as obesity, diabetes, and drug abuse agents; DE 2123784 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,813,395 disclose various piperazinylthieno-benzothiazepines as psychotropics and anesthetics; and WO 98/37077 and WO 99/42107describe certain piperazine-based compounds as calcitonin mimetics for treatment of bone deficits. Additionally, WO 97/42230 describes a solid-phase synthesis of certain piperazine ureas. WO 97/23458 discloses certain piperidine derivatives as intermediates toward NMDA receptor ligands. 4-(3-Phenyl-[1,2,4]thiadiazol-5-yl)-piperazine-1-carboxylic acid phenylamide (CAS No. 681136-29-8) is commercially available from Maybridge.

For the sake of brevity, the disclosures of the publications cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference.	As used herein, the terms “including”, “containing” and “comprising” are used herein in their open, non-limiting sense.	The term “alkyl” refers to a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain.

Exemplary alkylene groups include methylene, ethylene, propylene, and the like.	The term “alkenyl” refers to a straight- or branched-chain alkenyl group having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain. (The double bond of the alkenyl group is formed by two sp2 hybridized carbon atoms.) Illustrative alkenyl groups include prop-2-enyl, but-2-enyl, but-3-enyl, 2-methylprop-2-enyl, hex-2-enyl, and the like.	The term “alkynyl” refers to a straight- or branched-chain alkynyl group having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain. (The triple bond of the alkynyl group is formed by two sp hybridized carbon atoms.) Illustrative alkynyl groups include prop-2-ynyl, but-2-ynyl, but-3-ynyl, 2-methylbut-2-ynyl, hex-2-ynyl, and the like.	The term “aryl” refers to a monocyclic, or fused or spiro polycyclic, aromatic carbocycle (ring structure having ring atoms that are all carbon) having from 3 to 12 ring atoms per ring. (Carbon atoms in aryl groups are sp2 hybridized.) Illustrative examples of aryl groups include the following moieties:	The term “heteroaryl” refers to a monocyclic, or fused or spiro bicyclic or polycyclic, aromatic heterocycle (ring structure having ring atoms selected from carbon atoms as well as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur heteroatoms) having from 3 to 12 ring atoms per ring. Illustrative examples of aryl groups include the following moieties:	The term “cycloalkyl” refers to a saturated or partially saturated, monocyclic or fused or spiro polycyclic, carbocycle having from 3 to 12 ring atoms per ring. Illustrative examples of cycloalkyl groups include the following moieties:	A “heterocycloalkyl” refers to a monocyclic, or fused or spiro polycyclic, ring structure that is saturated or partially saturated and has from 3 to 12 ring atoms per ring selected from C atoms and N, O, and S heteroatoms. Illustrative examples of heterocycloalkyl groups include:	The term “halogen” represents chlorine, fluorine, bromine or iodine. The term “halo” represents chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo.	The term “substituted” means that the specified group or moiety bears one or more substituents. The term “unsubstituted” means that the specified group bears no substituents. The term “optionally substituted” means that the specified group is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents. Where the term “substituted” is used to describe a structural system, the substitution is meant to occur at any valency-allowed position on the system.	Formula (I) is intended to represent compounds having structures depicted by the structural formula as well as certain variations or forms. In particular, compounds of Formula (I) may have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. All optical isomers and stereoisomers of the compounds of the general formula, and mixtures thereof, are considered within the scope of the formula. Thus Formula (I) is intended to represent a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, one or more atropisomeric forms, and mixtures thereof.	Furthermore, certain structures depicted by Formula (I) may exist as geometric isomers (i.e., cis and trans isomers), as tautomers, or as atropisomers. Additionally, Formula (I) is intended to represent hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of such compounds, and mixtures thereof.	Formula (I) is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by Formula (I) except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36Cl, respectively. Various isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 11C, and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., 3H) and carbon-14 (i.e., 14C) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.	When referring to Formula (I), the selection of a particular moiety from a list of possible species for a specified variable is not intended to define the moiety for the variable appearing elsewhere. In other words, where a variable appears more than once, the choice of the species from a specified list is independent of the choice of the species for the same variable elsewhere in the formula.	In preferred embodiments of the invention, Ar1 is a phenyl, 2-naphthyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidinyl, or 2-thiazolyl group, unsubstituted or substituted at a carbon ring atom with one or two Ra moieties.

The invention includes also pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds represented by Formula (I). Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the above-described specific compounds are especially preferred.	A “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is intended to mean a salt of a free acid or base of a compound represented by Formula (I) that is not toxic, biologically intolerable, or otherwise biologically undesirable. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those that are pharmacologically effective and suitable for contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, or allergic response. A compound of Formula (I) may possess a sufficiently acidic group, a sufficiently basic group, or both types of functional groups, and accordingly react with a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable salts include sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogen-phosphates, dihydrogenphosphates, metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates, caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates, oxalates, malonates, succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, butyne-1,4-dioates, hexyne-1,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates, methylbenzoates, dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates, xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutyrates, citrates, lactates, γ-hydroxybutyrates, glycolates, tartrates, methane-sulfonates, propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1-sulfonates, naphthalene-2-sulfonates, and mandelates.	If the compound of Formula (I) is a base, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, nitric acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, phenylacetic acid, propionic acid, stearic acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, isethionic acid, succinic acid, valeric acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid, such as mandelic acid, citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, naphthoic acid, or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as laurylsulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.	If the compound of Formula (I) is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or the like. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include organic salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and arginine, ammonia, carbonates, bicarbonates, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic amines, such as benzylamines, pyrrolidines, piperidine, morpholine and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum and lithium.	The invention also relates to treatment methods employing pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of Formula (I). The term “prodrug” means a precursor of a designated compound that, following administration to a subject, yields the compound in vivo via a chemical or physiological process such as solvolysis or physiological conditions (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to physiological pH is converted to the compound of Formula (I)). A “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug” is a prodrug that is not toxic, biologically intolerable, or otherwise biologically unsuitable for administration to the subject.	Exemplary prodrugs include compounds having an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues, covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of Formula (I). Examples of amino acid residues include the twenty naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols as well as 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone.	Additional types of prodrugs may be produced, for instance, by derivatizing free carboxyl groups of structures of Formula (I) as amides or alkyl esters. Exemplary amides include those derived from ammonia, primary C1-6alkyl amines and secondary di(C1-6alkyl) amines. Secondary amines include 5- or 6-membered heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl ring moieties having from 1 to 3 heteroatoms where at least one is a nitrogen atom. Preferred amides are derived from ammonia, C1-3alkyl primary amines, and di(C1-2alkyl)amines. Exemplary esters of the invention include C1-7alkyl, C5-7carbocyclyl, phenyl, and phenyl(C1-6alkyl) esters. Preferred esters include methyl esters. Prodrugs may also be prepared by derivatizing free hydroxy groups using groups including hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, following procedures such as those outlined in Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1996, 19, 115. Carbamate derivatives of hydroxy and amino groups may also yield prodrugs. Carbonate derivatives, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups may also provide prodrugs. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with one or more ether, amine or carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, is also useful to yield prodrugs. Prodrugs of this type may be prepared as described in J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 10. Free amines can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these prodrug moieties may incorporate groups including ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities.	Pharmaceutically active metabolites may also be used in the methods of the invention. A “pharmaceutically active metabolite” means a pharmacologically active product of metabolism in the body of a compound of Formula (I) or salt thereof. Prodrugs and active metabolites of a compound may be determined using routine techniques known or available in the art. See, e.g., Bertolini et al., J. Med. Chem. 1997, 40, 2011-2016; Shan et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 1997, 86 (7), 765-767; Bagshawe, Drug Dev. Res. 1995, 34, 220-230; Bodor, Adv. Drug Res. 1984, 13, 224-331; Bundgaard, Design of Prodrugs (Elsevier Press, 1985); and Larsen, Design and Application of Prodrugs, Drug Design and Development (Krogsgaard-Larsen et al., eds., Harwood Academic Publishers, 1991).	The compounds of Formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, and pharmaceutically active metabolites (collectively, “agents”) of the present invention are useful as FAAH inhibitors in the methods of the invention. The agents may be used in the inventive methods for the treatment or prevention of medical conditions, diseases, or disorders mediated through inhibition or modulation of FAAH, such as those described herein. Agents according to the invention may therefore be used as an analgesic, neuroprotectant, sedative, appetite stimulant, or contraceptive.	Exemplary medical conditions, diseases, and disorders include anxiety, pain, sleep disorders, eating disorders, inflammation, multiple sclerosis and other movement disorders, HIV wasting syndrome, closed head injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy, Niemann-Pick disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, optic neuritis, autoimmune uveitis, symptoms of drug withdrawal, nausea, emesis, sexual dysfunction, post-traumatic stress disorder, or cerebral vasospasm.	Thus, the pharmaceutical agents may be used to treat subjects diagnosed with or suffering from a disorder or condition mediated through FMH activity. The term “treat” or “treating” as used herein is intended to refer to administration of an agent or composition of the invention to a subject for the purpose of effecting a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit through modulation of FAAH activity. Treating includes reversing, ameliorating, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, lessening the severity of, or preventing a disease, disorder or condition, or one or more symptoms of such disease, disorder or condition mediated through modulation of FAAH activity. The term “subject” refers to a mammalian patient in need of such treatment, such as a human. “Modulators” include both inhibitors and activators, where “inhibitors” refer to compounds that decrease, prevent, inactivate, desensitize or down-regulate FAAH expression or activity, and “activators” are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, sensitize or up-regulate FAAH expression or activity.	Accordingly, the invention relates to methods of using the pharmaceutical agents described herein to treat subjects diagnosed with or suffering from a disorder or condition mediated through FAAH activity, such as: anxiety, pain, sleep disorders, eating disorders, inflammation, or movement disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis).	Symptoms or disease states are intended to be included within the scope of “medical conditions, disorders, or diseases.” For example, pain may be associated with various diseases and disorders, and may include various etiologies. Illustrative types of pain treatable with a FAAH-modulating agent according to the invention include cancer pain, postoperative pain, GI tract pain, spinal cord injury pain, visceral hyperalgesia, thalamic pain, headache (including stress headache and migraine), low back pain, neck pain, musculoskeletal pain, peripheral neuropathic pain, central neuropathic pain, neurogenerative disorder related pain, and menstrual pain. HIV wasting syndrome includes associated symptoms such as appetite loss and nausea. Parkinson's disease includes, for example, levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Treatment of multiple sclerosis may include treatment of symptoms such as spasticity, neurogenic pain, central pain, or bladder dysfunction. Symptoms of drug withdrawal may be caused by, for example, addiction to opiates or nicotine. Nausea or emesis may be due to chemotherapy, postoperative, or opioid related causes. Treatment of sexual dysfunction may include improving libido or delaying ejaculation. Treatment of cancer may include treatment of glioma. Sleep disorders include, for example, sleep apnea, insomnia, and disorders calling for treatment with an agent having a sedative or narcotic-type effect. Eating disorders include, for example, anorexia or appetite loss associated with a disease such as cancer or HIV infection/AIDS.	In a treatment method according to the invention, an effective amount of a pharmaceutical agent according to the invention is administered to a subject suffering from or diagnosed as having such a disease, disorder or condition. An “effective amount” means an amount or dose sufficient to generally bring about the desired therapeutic or prophylactic benefit in patients in need of such treatment.	Effective amounts or doses of the agents of the present invention may be ascertained by routine methods such as modeling, dose escalation studies or clinical trials, and by taking into consideration routine factors, e.g., the mode or route of administration or drug delivery, the pharmacokinetics of the agent, the severity and course of the disorder or condition, the subject's previous or ongoing therapy, the subject's health status and response to drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. An exemplary dose is in the range of from about 0.001 to about 200 mg of agent per kg of subject's body weight per day, preferably about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg/day, or about 1 to 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided dosage units (e.g., BID, TID, QID). For a 70-kg human, an illustrative range for a suitable dosage amount is from about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, or about 0.2 to about 2.5 g/day.	Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, the dose may be adjusted for preventative or maintenance treatment. For example, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect is maintained. Of course, if symptoms have been alleviated to an appropriate level, treatment may cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.	
US7541359_0011	In addition, the agents of the invention may be used in combination with additional active compounds in the treatment of the above conditions. The additional compounds may be coadministered separately with an agent of Formula (I) or included with such an agent as an additional active ingredient in a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention. In an exemplary embodiment, additional active compounds are those that are known or discovered to be effective in the treatment of conditions, disorders, or diseases mediated by FAAH activity, such as another FAAH modulator or a compound active against another target associated with the particular condition, disorder, or disease. The combination may serve to increase efficacy (e.g., by including in the combination a compound potentiating the potency or effectiveness of an agent according to the invention), decrease one or more side effects, or decrease the required dose of the agent according to the invention. In one illustrative embodiment, a composition according to the invention may contain one or more additional active ingredients selected from opioids, NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, and naproxen), gabapentin, pregabalin, tramadol, acetaminophen, and aspirin.	The agents of the invention are used, alone or in combination with one or more other active ingredients, to formulate pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises: an effective amount of a pharmaceutical agent in accordance with the invention; and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.	A “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” refers to a substance that is not toxic, biologically intolerable, or otherwise biologically unsuitable for administration to a subject, such as an inert substance, added to a pharmacological composition or otherwise used as a vehicle, carrier, or diluent to facilitate administration of a pharmaceutical agent and that is compatible therewith. Examples of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols.	Delivery forms of the pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more dosage units of the pharmaceutical agents may be prepared using suitable pharmaceutical excipients and compounding techniques now or later known or available to those skilled in the art. The compositions may be administered in the inventive methods by oral, parenteral, rectal, topical, or ocular routes or by inhalation.	The preparation may be in the form of tablets, capsules, sachets, dragees, powders, granules, lozenges, powders for reconstitution, liquid preparations, or suppositories. Preferably, the compositions are formulated for intravenous infusion, topical administration, or oral administration.	For oral administration, the compounds of the invention can be provided in the form of tablets or capsules, or as a solution, emulsion, or suspension. To prepare the oral compositions, the agents may be formulated to yield a dosage of, e.g., from about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg daily, or from about 0.05 to about 20 mg/kg daily, or from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg daily.	Oral tablets may include the active ingredient mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservatives agents. Suitable inert fillers include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, lactose, starch, sugar, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol, and the like. Exemplary liquid oral excipients include ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Starch, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP), sodium starch glycolate, microcrystalline cellulose, and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin. The lubricating agent, if present, may be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, or may be coated with an enteric coating.	Capsules for oral administration include hard and soft gelatin capsules. To prepare hard gelatin capsules, active ingredient may be mixed with a solid, semi-solid, or liquid diluent. Soft gelatin capsules may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with water, an oil such as peanut oil or olive oil, liquid paraffin, a mixture of mono and di-glycerides of short chain fatty acids, polyethylene glycol 400, or propylene glycol.	Liquids for oral administration may be in the form of suspensions, solutions, emulsions or syrups or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid compositions may optionally contain: pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose, sodium alginate, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminum stearate gel and the like); non-aqueous vehicles, e.g., oil (for example, almond oil or fractionated coconut oil), propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol or water; preservatives (for example, methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid); wetting agents such as lecithin; and, if desired, flavoring or coloring agents.	The agents of this invention may also be administered by non-oral routes. For example, the compositions may be formulated for rectal administration as a suppository. For parenteral use, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous routes, the agents of the invention may be provided in sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions, buffered to an appropriate pH and isotonicity or in parenterally acceptable oil. Suitable aqueous vehicles include Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. Such forms will be presented in unit-dose form such as ampules or disposable injection devices, in multi-dose forms such as vials from which the appropriate dose may be withdrawn, or in a solid form or pre-concentrate that can be used to prepare an injectable formulation. Illustrative infusion doses may range from about 1 to 1000 μg/kg/minute of agent, admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier over a period ranging from several minutes to several days.	For topical administration, the agents may be mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier at a concentration of about 0.1% to about 10% of drug to vehicle. Another mode of administering the agents of the invention may utilize a patch formulation to affect transdermal delivery.	Agents may alternatively be administered in methods of this invention by inhalation, via the nasal or oral routes, e.g., in a spray formulation also containing a suitable carrier.

Supercoiled human FMH cDNA (1 μg) was added to the cells and mixed. The voltage for the electroporation was set at 0.25 kV, and the capacitance was set at 960 μF. After electroporation, the cells were diluted into complete media (10 mL) and plated onto four 10-cm dishes. Because of the variability in the efficiency of electroporation, four different concentrations of cells were plated. The ratios used were 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5, with the remainder of the cells being added to the fourth dish. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h before adding the selection media (complete media with 600 μg/mL G418). After 10 d, dishes were analyzed for surviving colonies of cells. Dishes with well-isolated colonies were used. Cells from individual colonies were isolated and tested. The clones that showed the most FAAH activity, as measured by anandamide hydrolysis, were used for further study.	B. FAAH Assay	T84 frozen cell pellets or transfected SK-N-MC cells (contents of 1×15 cm culture dishes) were homogenized in 50 mL of FAAH assay buffer (125 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Glycerol, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.4 mM Hepes, pH 9). The assay mixture consisted of 50 μL of the cell homogenate, 10 μL of the test compound, and 40 μL of anandamide [1-3H-ethanolamine] (3H-AEA, Perkin-Elmer, 10.3 Ci/mmol), which was added last, for a final tracer concentration of 80 nM. The reaction mixture was incubated at rt for 1 h. During the incubation, 96-well Multiscreen filter plates (catalog number MAFCNOB50; Millipore, Bedford, Me., USA) were loaded with 25 μL of activated charcoal (Multiscreen column loader, catalog number MACL09625, Millipore) and washed once with 100 μL of MeOH. Also during the incubation, 96-well DYNEX MicroLite plates (catalog number NL510410) were loaded with 100 μL of MicroScint40 (catalog number 6013641, Packard Bioscience, Meriden, Conn., USA). After the 1 h incubation, 60 μL of the reaction mixture were transferred to the charcoal plates, which were then assembled on top of the DYNEX plates using Centrifuge Alignment Frames (catalog number MACF09604, Millipore). The unbound labeled ethanolamine was centrifuged through to the bottom plate (5 min at 2000 rpm), which was preloaded with the scintillant, as described above. The plates were sealed and left at rt for 1 h before counting on a Hewlett Packard TopCount. Results for compounds tested in this assay are presented in Table 2.	TABLE 2	Ex.

Transfection of Cells with Rat FAAH	A 10-cm tissue culture dish with a confluent monolayer of SK-N-MC cells was split 2 days (d) prior to transfection. Using sterile technique, the media was removed and the cells were detached from the dish by the addition of trypsin. One fifth of the cells were then placed onto a new 10-cm dish. Cells were grown in a 37° C. incubator with 5% CO2 in Minimal Essential Media Eagle with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum. After 2 d, cells were approximately 80% confluent. These cells were removed from the dish with trypsin and pelleted in a clinical centrifuge. The pellet was re-suspended in 400 μL complete media and transferred to an electroporation cuvette with a 0.4 cm gap between the electrodes. Supercoiled rat FMH cDNA (1 μg) was added to the cells and mixed. The voltage for the electroporation was set at 0.25 kV, and the capacitance was set at 960 μF.

Publication Language: English (EN)	Filing Language: English (EN)	INDOLINE AND AZAINDOLINE DERIVATIVES AS 5-HTID ALPHA RECEPTOR AGONISTS	The present invention relates to a class of substituted indoline and azaindoline derivatives which act on 5-hydroxytxyptamine (5-HT) receptors, being selective agonists of so-called "5-HT?-like" receptors.	They are therefore useful in the treatment of clinical conditions for which a selective agonist of these receptors is indicated.	It has been known for some time that 5-HT?-like receptor agonists which exhibit selective vasoconstrictor activity are of use in the treatment of migraine (see, for example, A. Doenicke et al., The Lancet, 1988, Vol. 1,	1309-11).	The human 5-HT?-like or 5-HTID receptor has recently been shown by molecular cloning techniques to exist in two distinct subtypes. These subtypes have been termed 5-HTIDO (or 5-HTID-I) and 5-HTiDp (or 5-HTID-2), and their amino acid sequences are disclosed and claimed in	WO-A-91/17174.	The 5-HTiDa receptor subtype in humans is believed to reside on sensory terminals in the dura mater. Stimulation of the 5-HTiDa subtype inhibits the release of inflammatory neuropeptides which are thought to contribute to the headache pain of migraine. The human 5-HTiDp receptor subtype, meanwhile, is located predominantly on the blood vessels and in the brain, and hence may play a part in mediating constriction of cerebral and coronary arteries, as well as CNS effects.	Administration of the prototypical 5-HTID agonist sumatriptan (GR43175) to humans is known to give rise at therapeutic doses to certain adverse cardiovascular events (see, for example, F. Willett et al., Br. Med.	J., 1992, 304, 1415; J.P. Ottervanger et al., The Lancet, 1993, 341, 861-2; and D.N. Bateman, The Lancet, 1993, 341, 221-4). Since sumatriptan barely ?lsc- minates between the human 5-HTiDa and 5-HTiDp receptor subtypes (cf. WO-A-91/17174, Table 1), and since it is the blood vessels with which the 5-HTiDp subtype is most closely associated, it is believed that the cardiovascular side-effects observed with sumatriptan can be attributed to stimulation of the 5-HTiDp receptor subtype. It is accordingly considered (cf. G.W. Rebeck et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1994, 91, 3666-9) that compounds which can interact selectively with the 5-HTIDO receptor subtype, whilst having a less pronounced action at the 5-HTiDp subtype, might be free from, or at any rate less prone to, the undesirable cardiovascular and other side-effects associated with non-subtype-selective 5-HTID receptor agonists, whilst at the same time ma-Lntaining a beneficial level of anti-migraine activity.	The compounds of the present invention, being selective 5-HT?-like receptor agonists, are accordingly of benefit in the treatment of migraine and associated conditions, e.g. cluster headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, headache associated with vascular disorders, tension headache and paediatric migraine. In particular, the compounds according to this invention are potent agonists of the human 5-HTn a receptor subtype. Moreover, the compounds in accordance with this invention have been found to possess at least a 10-fold selective affinity for the 5-HTiDa receptor subtype relative to the 5-HTiDp subtype, and they can therefore be expected to manifest fewer side-effects than those associated with non-subtype-selective 5-HTID receptor agonists.	Several distinct classes of substituted five-membered	heteroaromatic compounds are described in published European patent applications 0438230, 0497512 and 0494774, and published International patent applications 93/18029, 94/02477 and 94/03446. The compounds described therein are stated to be agonists of 5-HT?-like receptors, and accordingly to be of particular use in the treatment of migraine and associated conditions. None of these publications, however, discloses nor even suggests the indoline and azaindoline derivatives provided by the present invention.	In EP-A-0548813 is described a series of alkoxypyridin-4-yl and alkoxypyrimidin-4-yl derivatives of indol-3-ylalkylpiperazines which are alleged to provide treatment of vascular or vascular-related headaches, including migraine. There is, however, no disclosure nor any suggestion in EP-A-0548813 of replacing the alkoxypyridine or a?-koxypvrimidine substituent with an optionally substituted aryl-alkyl or heteroaryl-alkyl substituent; nor of replacing the indole moiety with an indoline or azaindoline moiety; nor indeed is there any suggestion therein that the range of substituents specified at the 5-position of the indole moiety might be successfully replaced by an optionally substituted five-membered heteroaromatic ring.	Moreover, nowhere in the prior art available to date is there any disclosure of a subtype-selective 5-HTID receptor agonist having a 5-HTID,, receptor binding affinity (IC8) of 50 nM or less and at least a 10-fold selective affinity for the 5-HTID,, receptor subtype relative to the 5-HTiDp subtype.

The five-membered heteroaromatic ring Z in the compounds of formula I above may be optionally substituted by one or, where possible, two substituents. As will be appreciated, where Z represents an	oxadiazole, thiadiazole or tetrazole ring, only one substituent will be possible; otherwise, one or two optional substituents may be	accommodated around the five-membered heteroaromatic ring Z.

The compounds according to the invention have at least one asymmetric centre, and they may accordingly exist as enantiomers.	Where the compounds according to the invention possess two or more asymmetric centres, they may additionally exist as diastereoisomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof in any proportion are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.	In particular, the carbon atom at the 3-position of the indoline or azaindoline nucleus in formula I above is an asymmetric carbon atom, thereby giving rise to the possibility of (R) and (S) enantiomers. It is to be understood that the present invention relates to the individual (R) and (S) enantiomers of the compounds of formula I as well as to all possible mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures thereof.

The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions	comprising one or more compounds of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices or suppositories; for oral, parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. Typical unit dosage forms contain from 1 to 100 mg, for example 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg, of the active ingredient. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.	The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or gelatin.	In the treatment of migraine, a suitable dosage level is about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, preferably about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, and especially about 0.05 to 5 mg/kg per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day.	The compounds according to the invention may be prepared by a process which comprises N-alkylation of a compound of formula III:	(HI)	wherein Z, E, Q, T and R2 are as defined above.	Attachment of the R1 moiety to the compounds of formula III may conveniently be effected by standard alkylation techniques, for example by treatment with an aryl(C?-6)alkyl or heteroaryl(C?^)alkyl halide such as benzyl iodide, benzyl bromide or 3-(chloromethyl)pyridine, typically under basic conditions, e.g. sodium hydride or potassium carbonate in	-V, -dimethylformamide, or triethylamine in acetonitrile. Alternatively, the R1 moiety may conveniently be attached by a reductive alkylation procedure, which comprises treating the required compound of formula III as defined above with the appropriate aldehyde, e.g. benzaldehyde, in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydri.de.	The compounds of formula III above may be prepared by reducing a compound of formula IV:	(IV)	wherein Z, E, Q, T and R2 are as defined above.	Reduction of compound IV is conveniently effected by catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst, e.g. palladium on carbon, typically at an elevated pressure, e.g. a pressure in the region of 60 psi, and advantageously under acidic conditions, e.g. as a solution in 4M hydrochloric acid.	The compounds of formula IV above wherein T represents CH may be prepared by a process which comprises reacting a compound of formula V:	(V)	wherein Z and E are as defined above; with a compound of formula VI, or a carbonyl-protected form thereof: - l -	(VI)	wherein is as defined above, and Rp represents an amino-protecting group; followed, where required, by N-alkylation by standard methods to introduce the moiety R2; with subsequent removal of the amino-protecting group Rp.	The reaction between compounds V and VI, which is an example of the well-known Fischer indole synthesis, is suitably carried out by heating the reagents together under mildly acidic conditions, e.g. 4% sulphuric acid at reflux.	Suitable carbonyl-protected forms of the compounds of formula VI include the dimethyl acetal derivatives.	The protecting group RP in the compounds of formula VI is suitably a carbamoyl moiety such as t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), which can	conveniently be removed as necessary by treatment under mildly acidic conditions. Indeed, the acidic conditions of the Fischer indole synthesis reaction will generally suffice to remove the BOC group.	The Fischer reaction between compounds V and VI may be carried out in a single step, or may proceed via an initial non-cyclising step at a lower temperature to give an intermediate of formula VII:	(VII)	wherein Z, E, Q and Rp are as defined above; followed by cydisation using a suitable reagent, e.g. a polyphosphate ester.	The intermediates of formula VI, or carbonyl-protected forms thereof, may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VIII, or a carbonyl-protected form thereof, with a compound of formula DC:	(VIII) (IX)	wherein Q and RP are as defined above, and L1 represents a suitable leaving group.	The leaving group L1 is suitably a halogen atom, e.g. chlorine or bromine.	Where L1 represents a halogen atom, the reaction between compounds VIII and IX is conveniently effected by stirring the re act ants under basic conditions in a suitable solvent, for example sodium carbonate in dimethoxyethane, potassium carbonate in ,-V-dimethylforp?amide, or triethylamine in tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile, optionally in the presence of catalytic sodium iodide.	In an alternative procedure, the compounds of formula IV above may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula IX as defined above with a compound of formula X:	
WO1996004269_0004	(X)	wherein Z, E, Q, T and R2 are as defined above, and L2 represents a suitable leaving group; followed by removal of the amino-protecting group Rp.	The leaving group L2 is suitably an alkylsulphonyloxy or	arylsulphonyloxy group, e.g. methanesulphonyloxy (mesyloxy) or -toluenesulphonyloxy (tosyloxy).	Where L2 represents an alkylsulphonyloxy or arylsulphonyloxy group, the reaction between compounds IX and X is conveniently carried out in a suitable solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, typically in the presence of a base such as sodium carbonate.	In a representative embodiment, the compounds of formula X wherein T represents CH, R2 is hydrogen, Q represents a propylene chain and L2 represents a mesyloxy or tosyloxy group may be prepared by reacting 3,4-dihydro-2iJT-pyran with a compound of formula V as defined above or a salt thereof, under a variant of the Fischer reaction conditions as described above for the reaction between compounds V and VI; followed by mesylation or tosylation of the 3-hydroxypropyl-indole derivative thereby obtained, typically by treatment with mesyl chloride or tosyl chloride under standard conditions.	The Fischer reaction with 3,4-dihydro-2i3T-pyran is suitably brought about by heating an acid addition salt of the hydrazine derivative V, typically the hydrochloride salt, in an inert solvent such as dioxan, at the reflux temperature of the solvent.	The compounds according to the invention may also be prepared by a process which comprises reducing a compound of formula XI:	(XI) wherein Z, E, T, R1 and R2 are as defined above, and -Q1-CH2- corresponds to the moiety as defined above.	The reaction is suitably carried out by treating the compound of formula XI with a reducing agent such as lithium aluminium hydride in an appropriate solvent, e.g. diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, or mixtures thereof.	The compounds of formula XI above may suitably be prepared by reacting a compound of formula XII with a compound of formula XHI:	(XII) (XIII)	wherein Z, E, T, R1, R2 and Q1 are as defined above, and J represents a reactive carboxylate moiety.	Suitable values for the reactive carboxylate moiety J include esters, for example Ci 4 alkyl esters; acid anhydrides, for example mixed anhydrides with C?-4 alkanoic acids; acid halides, for example acid chlorides; and acylimidazoles.	By way of example, the intermediates of formula XII above wherein J is an acid chloride moiety may be prepared by treating the corresponding carboxylic acid derivative with thionyl chloride in toluene.	Similarly, the intermediates of formula XII wherein J is an acylimidazole moiety may be prepared by treating the corresponding carboxylic acid derivative with l. l'-carbonyldiimidazole. Alternatively, the reactive carboxylate moiety J may be obtained by treating the corresponding compound wherein J is carboxy with l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3- ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and 1-hydroxybenzo triazole hydrate, optionally in the presence of triethylamine; the resulting activated carboxylate intermediate may then suitably be reacted in situ with the required compound of formula XIII.	The hydrazine derivatives of formula V above may be prepared by methods analogous to those described in EP-A-0438230 and	EP-A-0497512.	Where they are not commercially available, the starting materials of formula VHI, IX, XII and XHI may be prepared by methods analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples, or by standard procedures well known from the art.	It will be understood that any compound of formula I initially obtained from any of the above processes may, where appropriate, subsequently be elaborated into a further compound of formula I by techniques known from the art. For example, a compound of formula I wherein R2 is hydrogen initially obtained may be converted into a compound of formula I wherein R2 represents Ci-e alkyl by standard alkylation techniques, for example by treatment with an alkyl iodide, e.g. methyl iodide, typically under basic conditions, e.g. sodium hydride in dimethylformamide, or triethylamine in acetonitrile.	Where the above-described processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixtures of	stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The novel compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The novel compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques such as preparative HPLC, or the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-_p-toluoyl-d-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-l-tartaric acid, followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The novel compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromato graphic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary.	During any of the above synthetic sequences it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene & P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the art.	The following Examples illustrate the preparation of compounds according to the invention.	The compounds in accordance with the present invention potently and selectively bind to the 5-HTID<_ receptor subtype, inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, and stimulate [35S]-GTP?S binding to membranes from clonal cell lines expressing human cloned receptors.	5-HTiDa/d-HTiDp Radioligand Binding	Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) clonal cell lines expressing the human 5-HTiDa and 5-HTiDp receptors were harvested in PBS and homogenised in ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7 at room temperature) with a Kinematica polytron and centrifuged at 48,000g at 4°C for 11 min. The pellet was then resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl followed by a 10 min incubation at 37°C. Finally the tissue was recentrifuged at 48,000g, 4°C for 11 min and the pellet resuspended, in assay buffer (composition in mM: Tris-HCl 50, pargyline 0.01, CaCl2 4; ascorbate 0.1%; pH 7.7 at room temperature) to give the required volume immediately prior to use (0.2 mg protein/ml). Incubations were carried out for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of 0.02-150 nM [3H]-5-HT for saturation studies or 2-5 nM	[3H]-5-HT for displacement studies. The final assay volume was 1 ml.	5-HT (10 µM) was used to define non-specific binding. The reaction was initiated by the addition of membrane and was terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters (presoaked in 0.3% PEI/ 0.5% Triton X) followed by 2 x 4 ml washings with 50 mM Tris-HCl. The radioactive filters were then counted on a LKB beta or a Wallac beta plate counter. Binding parameters were determined by non-linear, least squares regression analysis using an iterative curve fitting routine, from which ICso (the molar concentration of compound necessary to inhibit binding by 50%) values could be calculated for each test compound. The ICso values for binding to the 5-HTiDa receptor subtype obtained for the compounds of the accompanying Examples were 50 nM or less in each case. Furthermore, the compounds of the accompanying Examples were all found to possess a selective affinity for the 5-HTiDa receptor subtype of at least 10-fold relative to the 5-HTiDp subtype.	5-HTiDa/5-HTiDp Adenylyl Cyclase Assay	Studies were performed essentially as described in J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1986, 238, 248. CHO clonal cell lines expressing the human cloned 5-HTiDa and 5-HTiDp receptors were harvested in PBS and homogenised, using a motor driven teflon/glass homogeniser, in ice cold Tris HC1-EGTA buffer (composition in mM: Tris HC1 10, EGTA 1, pH 8.0 at room temperature) and incubated on ice for 30-60 min. The tissue was then centrifuged at 20,000g for 20 min at 4°C, the supernatant discarded and the pellet resuspended in Tris HC1-EDTA buffer (composition in mM: Tris HC1 50, EDTA 5, pH 7.6 at room temperature) just prior to assay. The adenylyl cyclase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of a- PJ-ATP to [33P]-cyclic AMP. A 10 µl aliquot of the membrane suspension was incubated, for 10-15 min, in a final volume of 50 µl, at	30°C, with or without forskolin (10 µM), in the presence or absence of test compound. The incubation buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris HC1 (pH 7.6 at room temperature), 100 mM NaCl, 30 µM GTP, 50 µM cydic AMP, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCk, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine, 3.5 mM creat-nine phosphate, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.5-1 µCi a-[33P]-ATP and 1 nCi [3H]-cyclic AMP. The incubation was initiated by the addition of membrane, following a 5 min preincubation at 30°C, and was terminated by the addition of 100 µl SDS (composition in mM: sodium lauryl sulphate 2%, ATP 45, cyclic AMP 1.3, pH 7.5 at room temperature). The ATP and cydic AMP were separated on a double column chromatography system (Anal. Biochem., 1974, 58, 541). Functional parameters were determined using a least squares curve fitting programme ALLFIT (Am. J. PhysioL, 1978, 235, E97) from which Emu (maximal effect) and EC50 (the molar concentration of compound necessary to inhibit the maximal effect by 50%) values were obtained for each test compound. Of those compounds which were tested in this assay, the ECso values for the 5-HTiDa receptor obtained for the compounds of the accompanying Examples were 500 nM or less in each case. Moreover, the compounds of the accompanying Examples which were tested were all found to possess at least a 10-fold selectivity for the 5-HT.Da receptor subtype relative to the 5-HTiDp subtype.	5-HTiDa/5-HTiDp GTP?S Binding	Studies were performed essentially as described in Br. J.	Pharmacol., 1993, 109, 1120. CHO donal cell fines expressing the human doned 5-HTiDa and 5-HTmp receptors were harvested in PBS and homogenised using a Kinematica polytron in ice cold 20 mM HEPES containing 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 at room temperature. The membranes were then centrifuged at 40,000g, 4°C for 15 min. The pellet was then resuspended in ice cold 20 mM HEPES containing 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 at room temperature and recentrifuged at 40,000g, 4°C for 15-25 minutes.	The membranes were then resuspended in assay buffer (composition in mM: HEPES 20, NaCl 100, MgCl2 10, pargyline 0.01; ascorbate 0.1%; pH 7.4 at room temperature) at a concentration of 40 µg protein/ml for the 5-HTiDa receptor transfected cells and 40-50 µg protein/ml for the 5-HTiDp receptor transfected cells. The membrane suspension was then incubated, in a volume of 1 ml, with GDP (100 µM for 5-HTiDa receptor transfected cells, 30 µM for the 5-HTiDp receptor transfected cells) and test compound at 30°C for 20 min and then transferred to ice for a further 15 min.	[8SJ-GTP?S was then added at a final concentration of 100 pM and the samples incubated for 30 min at 30°C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of membrane and was terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF B filters and washed with 5 ml water. The radioactive filters were then counted on a LKB beta counter. Functional parameters were determined by a non-linear, least squares regression analysis using an iterative curve fitting routine, from which E x (maximal effect) and ECdo (the molar concentration of compound necessary to inhibit the maximal effect by 50% values) were obtained for each test compound. Of those compounds which were tested in this assay, the ECso values for the 5-HTiDa receptor obtained for the compounds of the accompanying	Examples were 500 nM or less in each case. Moreover, the compounds of the accompanying Examples which were tested were all found to possess at least a 10-fold selectivity for the 5-HTiDa receptor subtype relative to the 5-HTiDp subtype.

The compounds of the formula (I) can form acid addition salts with acids, such as conventional pharmaceutically acceptable acids, for example maleic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, acetic, fumaric, salicylic, citric, lactic, mandelic, tanaric and methanesulphonic.	The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which process comprises the coupling of a compound of formula (II):	with a compound of formula (III):	wherein A, B, C, and D are as defined in formula (I), E is as defined in formula (I) or is a group NR1 , L is a leaving group and X is hydrogen or a metal atom, and the variables, R1 ', R2' and R3 are R1 , R2 and R3 respectively, as defined in formula (I), or groups convertible thereto, and thereafter optionally and as necessary and in any appropriate order, convening any R1' , R2' and R3' when other than R1, R2 and R3 respectively to R1, R2 and R3, interconverting R1, R2 and R3 and forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.	Suitably L is a leaving group such as halogen, in particular chloro.	Suitably X is hydrogen or a metal atom such as lithium or magnesium.	Interconversion of a compound of formula (I) into another compound of formula (I) is carried out by conventional procedures well known in the art.	For example, in the case wherein R1 is hydrogen, it is possible to introduce a	C1 -6alkyl group by conventional alkylation using 1 molar equivalent of a C1 -6alkyl halide and 1 molar equivalent of a suitable base in an inert solvent.	It should be appreciated that it may be necessary to protect certain reactive groups during coupling reaction (a) above. Suitable protecting groups and methods for their attachment and removal are conventional in the art of organic chemistry, such as those described in Greene T.W. 'Protective groups in organic synthesis' New York, Wiley (1981).	Compounds of formula (II) are known compounds or can be prepared from compounds of formula (IV):	in which R2 ' , A, B, C, D and E are as defined in formula (II) using standard procedures.	Compounds of formula (III) can be prepared according to the procedures outlined in WO 95/01976. Compounds of formula (IV) are commercially available or can be prepared using standard procedures.	Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared conventionally by reaction with the appropriate acid or acid derivative.	Compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have 5HT2B/2C receptor antagonist activity and are believed to be of potential use fo the treatment or prophylasis of CNS disorders such as anxiety, depression, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, Alzheimers disease, sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, panic attacks, withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. Compounds of the invention are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain GI disorders such as IBS as well as microvascular diseases such as macular oedema and retinopathy.	Thus the invention also provides a compound of formula (I) or a	pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use as a therapeutic substance, in particular in the treatment or prophylaxis of the above disorders.	The invention further provides a method of treatment or prophylaxis of the above disorders, which comprises administering to the sufferer a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.	In another aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis the above disorders.	The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.	A pharmaceutical composition of the invention, which may be prepared by admixture, suitably at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, is usually adapted for oral, parenteral or rectal administration and, as such, may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable powders, injectable or infusible solutions or suspensions or suppositories. Orally administrable compositions are generally preferred.	Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose form, and may contain conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, tabletting lubricants, disintegrants and acceptable wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice.	Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspension, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be in the form of a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid	preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), preservatives, and, if desired, conventional flavourings or colorants.	For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilising a compound of the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions, the compound can be dissolved for injection and filter sterilised before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents are dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved, and sterilisation cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspension in a sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.	
WO1996011929_0003	The composition may contain from 0.1% to 99% by weight, preferably from 10 to 60% by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration.	The dose of the compound used in the treatment of the aforementioned disorders will vary in the usual way with the seriousness of the disorders, the weight of the sufferer, and other similar factors. However, as a general guide suitable unit doses may be 0.05 to 1000 mg, more suitably 0.05 to 20.0 mg, for example 0.2 to 5 mg; and such unit doses may be administered more than once a day, for example two or three a day, so that the total daily dosage is in the range of about 0.01 to 100 mg; and such therapy may extend for a number of weeks or months.

The compounds inhibit acyl-CoA: cholesterol	acyltransferase (ACAT), the enzyme responsible for the esterification of dietary cholesterol. Such agents thus decrease the absorption of dietary cholesterol and therefore provide a therapy for individuals with hypercholesterolemia and	atherosclerosis.	High levels of cholesterol have been associated with heightened risk for development of several disease states, most notably coronary heart disease. A great deal of effort has been devoted to finding ways to lower cholesterol levels in biological systems. The approach of lowering cholesterol intake by modifying diet has met with only limited success. The ACAT enzyme is known to catalyze the	esterification of dietary cholesterol, and has been implicated in several aspects of the atherosclerotic process in animals. One approach to lowering	cholesterol then is to inhibit the ACAT enzyme.	While several ACAT inhibitors have been identified (see for example EP 0570245), the need continues to identify and develop new ACAT inhibitors having improved therapeutic properties.	An object of this invention is therefore to provide a new series of compounds which are ß-carboxy sulfonate derivatives and which have demonstrated excellent ACAT inhibitory properties. Another object is to provide pharmaceutical formulations comprising the sulfonates and a carrier or excipient, and a ethod for inhibiting the ACAT enzyme by	administering a compound of the invention.

A preferred embodiment of this invention includes compounds having the formula	where Y is O, S, or NH, and especially NH.	Also preferred are compounds of the formula	where Y is O, S, or NH, and especially NH.	Another class of compounds provided by the invention have the formula	Another class of invention compounds have the formula	where Y is O, S, or NH, and substituted phenyl is phenyl having 1, 2, or 3 substituents as defined above.	Another preferred group of compounds of the invention have the formula	Still other compounds of the invention have the formula	wherein R2, R3, R4, R11 , W, n', Q, and Z are as defined above, and Y is O, S, or NH.	The compounds of this invention are prepared by any of several synthetic routes utilizing routine methodology well known to those skilled in the art of organic chemistry. The compounds are prepared from readily available starting materials and reactants.	In a preferred embodiment, compounds of	Formula II	are prepared by reacting an alcohol, thiol, or amine of the formula H-Y-R5 with an sulfonic acetyl halide of the formula	,	where R1 is as defined above and halo is preferably bromo or chloro. The sulfonic acetvl halides are readily prepared by starting with a sulfonic acetic acid, which can be reacted with an alcohol to give the corresponding sulfonic acetic acid ester, which reacts with a halogenating agent to give the	corresponding sulfonyl halide. The sulfonyl halide is reacted with an alcohol R1 OH to provide the corresponding sulfonic acetic acid ester. The ester is readily hydrolyzed to the acid, which is then converted to the corresponding sulfonic acetyl halide. The above reaction is depicted by the general scheme of Chart I as follows:	In a typical synthesis, for example, sulfoacetic acid (1) is reacted with ethanol at about 50°C for 2 hours to give the acetic acid ethyl ester (2 where alkyl is ethyl). The ethyl ester is reacted with a halogenating agent such as phosphorus oxychloride to give the corresponding sulfonylchloride (3 where halo is chloro).	The sulfonyl chloride 3 is reacted with an alcohol (preferably a phenol, especially a di- or trisubstituted phenol) to produce the sulfonate acetic acid ester 4. The ester 4 is readily	converted to an acid halide by first hydrolyzing the ester, for instance by reaction with an alkaline base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to give the sulfonate acetic acid, and then reacting the acid with a halogenating agent such as oxalyl	chloride or the like to give an acid halide 5. The acid chloride 5 is reacted with about an equimolar quantity of an alcohol, thiol, or amine of the formula HYR5 to give the invention compound of	Formula II. This latter reaction typically is carried out in an unreactive organic solvent such as methylene chloride or toluene, and normally is complete in about 2 to 24 hours when carried out at about 20-60°C. The product of Formula II is readily isolated by routine methods, and purified if desired by crystallization or chromatography over solid supports such as silica, eluting with common solvents such as ethyl acetate, acetone, and the like.	An alternative method for preparing compounds of the invention comprises reacting a sulfonate acetic acid with an amine, alcohol, or thiol in the presence of a coupling reagent such as those commonly utilized in peptide synthesis. Typical peptide coupling reagents include N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydro-quinoline (EEDQ) and carbonyldiimidazole (CDI). This direct coupling reaction is preferred for preparing	invention compounds in which one or both of R3 and R4 of Formula I are other than hydrogen. For example, a preferred class of invention compounds have the formula	wherein R3 is phenyl or naphthyl, or substituted phenyl or substituted naphthyl as defined above.	The use of a coupling reagent is depicted in Chart I, and is given in more detail in Chart II below:	In the above Scheme II, a sulfonyl halide, such as the chloride (2), is reacted with an alcohol R2OH to give the sulfonate 3. The sulfonate is reacted with a strong base such as n-butyl lithium, generally in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a reduced temperature of about -70°C, to produce a lithio salt, which generally is not isolated but is reacted directly with carbon dioxide to give the acetic acid (4). The acetic acid is reacted with an amine H2NR5, an alcohol HOR5, or a thiol HSR5, in the presence of a coupling reagent to afford the invention compound (5). The coupling reaction generally is conducted in an unreactive organic solvent such as dichloromethane and normally is complete in about 2 to 24 hours when carried out at about 20°C to about 60°C. The product (5) is readily isolated by routine procedures such as filtration and evaporation of solvents, and it is further purified if desired by crystallization, chromatography, or the like.	Compounds of Formula I wherein one or both of R3 and R4 are other than hydrogen can alternatively be prepared simply by reacting a Formula I compound in which one or both of R3 and R4 are hydrogen with a strong base such as sodium hydride to form an anion, followed by reaction with a compound of the formula R3L or R4L, where L is a leaving group such as	halogen, especially chloro, iodo, or bromo. This reaction scheme is depicted in Chart III as follows:	The invention compound (1) is reacted with about 1 M equivalent of sodium hydride to give anion (2), which is not isolated but rather is reacted directly with R3L, for example methyl chloride, 1-naphthyl chloride, cyclopropyl iodide, phenyl iodide, or the like, to give the a-substituted sulfonamide acetic acid derivative (3). If desired, the compound (3) can be further reacted with a molar equivalent of sodium hydride, followed by reaction with R4L, to give the a,a-disubstituted compound (4).	The synthesis of specific compounds provided by this invention is presented in the following detailed examples. The examples are illustrative only, and the invention is not limited to the compounds	actually made or the synthetic routes utilized.	EXAMPLE 1

The compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of the enzyme acyl-CoA:	cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), and are thus effective in inhibiting the esterification and transport of cholesterol across the intestinal cell wall. The compounds of the present invention are thus useful in pharmaceutical formulations for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and	atherosclerosis, and in general lipid regulation.	The ability of representative compounds of the present invention to inhibit ACAT was measured using an in vitro test more fully described in F.J. Field and R.G. Salone, Biochemica et Biophysica Acta,	712:557-570 (1982). The test assesses the ability of a test compound to inhibit the acylation of	cholesterol by oleic acid by measuring the amount of radiolabeled cholesterol oleate formed from	radiolabeled oleic acid in a tissue preparation containing rat liver microsomes (designated LAI).	These data appear in Table 1 where they are expressed as IC50 values; i.e., the micromolar concentration of test compound required to inhibit the activity of the enzyme by 50%.	In an in vivo screen designated APCC, male	Sprague-Dawley rats (200-225 g body weight) were randomly divided into treatment groups and dosed at 4 PM with either vehicle (CMC/Tween) or suspensions of invention compounds in vehicle. The normal chow diet was then replaced with a high fat, high	cholesterol diet (5.5% peanut oil, 1.5% cholesterol, and 0.5% cholic acid). The rats consumed this diet ad libitum during the night and were sacrificed at	8 AM to obtain blood samples for cholesterol analysis using standard procedures. Statistical differences between mean cholesterol values for the same vehicle were determined using analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant test. The results of this trial for representative compounds of the present invention also appear in Table I as the percent change in total cholesterol (%TC) from control animals given vehicle and diet only. All compounds in the APCC test reported in Table 1 were administered by gavage at 30 mg/kg.	In therapeutic use as agents for treating	hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerosis, the compounds of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are administered to the patient at a dosage which is effective in inhibiting ACAT. Such ACAT-inhibiting levels generally are from about 50 to about 3000 mg per day, ideally from about 100 to about	1000 mg per day. For a normal human adult of	approximately 70 kg of body weight, a typical dosage of from about 1 to about 40 mg/kg of body weight per day will be utilized. The specific dosages employed, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the activity of the compound being	employed. The determination of optimum dosages for a particular situation is within the skill of the art.	For preparing the pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of this invention, inert,	pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, and cachets.	A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, or tablet disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating material.	In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding	properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.	Powders and tablets preferably contain between about 5% to about 70% by weight of the active	ingredient. Suitable carriers are magnesium	
WO1996019444_0008	dicarbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, lactose, sugar, pectin, dextrin, starch, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a low-melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like.	The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component (with or without carriers) is	surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. In a similar manner, cachets are also	included.	Tablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral	administration. Sustained-release formulation can be prepared utilizing conventional techniques such as polymers, osmotic pumps, wax, and the like.	Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, or emulsions suitable for oral	administration. Aqueous solutions for oral	administration can be prepared by dissolving the active compound in water and adding suitable flavorants, coloring agents, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water together with a viscous material such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other suspending agents known to the pharmaceutical formulation art.	Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate	quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation containing discrete quantities of the preparation, for example, packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet, or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of these packaged forms.	The following examples further illustrate typical pharmaceutical formulations provided by this invention.	EXAMPLE 11	A pharmaceutical formulation in the form of hard gelatin capsules for oral administration are prepared using the following ingredients:	The above ingredients are mixed and filled into hard gelatin capsules in 460 mg quantities. A typical active ingredient is 2,6-diisopropylphenyl N-(2-methyl-3-bromophenylmethyl)carbamoylmethyl sulfonate.	EXAMPLE 12	The sorbitol solution is added to 40 mL of	distilled water and the tetrazole acetamide is	suspended therein. The saccharin, sodium benzoate, and flavoring are added and dissolved. The volume is adjusted to 100 mL with distilled water. Each	milliliter of syrup contains 5 mg of active ingredient.	EXAMPLE 13	Tablets each containing 60 mg of active	ingredient.	The active ingredients, starch and cellulose, are passed through a No. 45 mesh U.S. sieve and mixed thoroughly. The solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone is mixed with the resultant powders and then passed through a No. 14 mesh U.S. sieve. The granules are dried at 50-60°C and passed through a No. 18 mesh U.S. sieve. The sodium carboxymethyl starch, magnesium stearate, and talc, previously passed through a No. 60 mesh U.S. sieve, are then added to the granules which, after mixing, are compressed on a tablet machine to yield tablets each weighing 150 mg.	A typical active ingredient utilized in the above preparation is the compound of Example 1.	EXAMPLE 14	A parenteral composition suitable for	administration by injection is prepared by dissolving 100 mg of 3-trifluoromethylphenyl phenoxycarbonylmethyl sulfonate in 250 mL of 0.9% aqueous sodium chloride solution and adjusting the pH of the solution to about 7.0.	EXAMPLE 15	Preparation for Suppositories	A mixture of 500 mg of 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl	(n-dodecylthiocarbonyl)methyl sulfonate and 1500 mg of theobroma oil are blended to uniformity at 60°C. The mixture is cooled to 24°C in tapered molds. Each suppository will weight about 2 g and can be	administered from 1 to 2 times each day for regulation of lipids and treatment of hypercholesterolemia.	CLAIMS	1.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FIELD	Serine proteases are produced within the cells of many living organisms and are often secreted to act outside of the producing cell. Individual serine proteases may target specific substrates (e.g., an inactive precursor for conversion to its biologically active form) or may act non-specifically (e.g., degradation of proteins or other peptides by scission). Further, individual serine proteases may be highly selective in that they recognize only one or a few related subsequences or non-selective in that they recognize and cleave a variety of unrelated sequences.	Serine proteases have a highly conserved active site, wherein specific amino acids which catalyze the bond scission have nearly identical spatial arrangements. A complementary binding site adjacent to the active site provides for the primary specificity of any individual serine protease. A succession of indentations or	"pockets" along the surface of the protease serve to bind successive amino acid side chains along the substrate polypeptide chain on either side of the peptide bond to be cleaved. Substrate side chains which contribute to the association with the protease are designated P1, P2, P3, etc., proceeding from the side chain proximate to the susceptible bond toward the amino terminal of the protein, and P1', P2', P3', etc., proceeding from the side chain proximate to the susceptible bond toward the carboxyl terminal of the protein. Small molecules having suitable P binding moieties can be designed to mimic the substrate by occupying the substrate's binding site and inhibit the function of the serine protease.	Serine proteases provide a diverse array of biological functions. Important serine proteases include trypsin-like proteases, such as trypsin, tryptase, thrombin, plasma kallikrein, tissue kallikrein and factor Xa. Substrates for serine proteases are associated, for example, with blood clotting, complement mediated lysis, the immune response, glomerulonephritis, pain sensing, inflammation, pancreatitis, cancer, regulating fertilization, bacterial infection and viral maturation. Accordingly, appropriate drug therapies can comprise the inhibition of a particular serine protease implicated in the pathology and/or symptomatology of a disease. Hence, substantial interest exists in the identification of serine protease inhibitors which possess high selectivity for specific serine proteases.	The disclosure of other documents referred to throughout this application are incorporated herein by reference.

Presently Preferred Embodiments:	
WO1998022619_0003	While the broadest definition of this invention is set forth in the Summary of the Invention, certain aspects of the invention are preferred. For example, preferred is a method for determining the serine protease inhibitory activity of a compound, which method comprises contacting the compound with a serine protease in a medium having present therein a divalent metal cation selected from the group consisting of zinc and cobalt, wherein the cation has the capacity for interaction with the compound and thereby to potentiate any serine protease inhibitory activity possessed by the compound and the concentration of the divalent metal cation in the medium is modified to a level sufficient to produce any such interaction; more preferably wherein the divalent metal cation is zinc.	Preferred methods of this invention are those in which an amount of zinc is present in the assay medium that is at least equal to the concentration of the serine protease inhibitor. Generally, the amount of zinc included in a preparation or medium containing the inhibitor will be at least 0.1 µM, typically at least 1 µM, more preferably at least 1 µM, and more preferably at least 100 µM. Typically, the zinc concentration employed will provide that at least about 80%, preferably at least about 90%, and more preferably substantially all of the inhibitor will be chelated with zinc. In physiological systems, the amount of zinc present will normally be sufficient to provide zinc complexes.	If the serine protease is sensitive to inhibition by the divalent metal cation, the method further may comprise contacting the compound with a serine protease in a medium having present therein a metal buffering agent capable of reducing the free concentration of the divalent metal cation to the extent that the serine protease is not substantially inhibited by the presence of the divalent metal cation while providing sufficient divalent metal cation by exchange equilibrium to produce the interaction. A typical metal buffer agent will have a Kd for chelation of the relevant divalent metal cation and will be present in suitable amounts such that the free concentration of the divalent metal cation is reduced to the extent that the cation is less available for association with the serine protease but the cation is available for association simultaneously with the protease and the protease inhibitor. Thus, the metal buffering agent will sequester all or most of the dissociated cation and readily transfer the cation to form a binary complex with the inhibitor or a ternary complex with inhibitor and protease (herein defined as exchange equilibrium). For example, a preferred method for determining the serine protease inhibitory activity of a compound wherein zinc is present in the medium and the serine protease is sensitive to inhibition by the zinc, further may comprise contacting the compound with a serine protease in a medium having present therein oxalate as the metal buffering agent.	Methods by which the concentration of the divalent metal cation can be modified and that fall within the intended scope of this invention include, but are not limited to, adding an appropriate amount of the divalent metal cation to the assay medium after the compound is contacted with the protease, mixing the assay reagents together with an appropriate amount of the divalent metal cation such that the desired final concentration of the divalent metal cation in the assay medium is achieved, selecting assay reagents by the levels of the divalent metal cation that are incidentally present so that after combining the reagents the final concentration of the divalent metal cation in the assay medium is achieved, and any other method that is applied for the purpose of adjusting the concentration in the assay medium such that it falls within the limitations of this invention.	Preferred is a method for determining whether the inhibitory activity of a serine protease inhibitor is enhanced by the presence of a divalent metal cation selected from the group consisting of zinc and cobalt, which method comprises:	(a) assaying for the inhibition of a serine protease by the inhibitor, wherein the assay is conducted in a medium that is essentially devoid of dissociated divalent metal cations; and	(b) assaying for the inhibition of the serine protease by the compound under essentially equivalent assay conditions to those used in Step (a), with the exception that the assay performed in Step (b) is conducted in a medium that contains an effective concentration of the divalent metal cation; wherein the inhibitory activity of the compound when measured by Step (b) is significantly greater than the inhibitory activity of the compound when measured by Step (a); more preferably wherein the divalent metal cations are removed from the medium used in Step (a) by the presence of a cation sequestering agent and most preferably wherein the divalent metal cation is zinc.	A typical cation sequestering agent will have a Kd for chelation of the relevant divalent metal cation such that the divalent metal cation is not available for association with the compound. For example, cation sequestering agents suitable in the practice of this invention include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), phenanthroline, and any other common cation sequestering agent which has no effect on the protease activity on its own, preferably EDTA). Standard assay formats for the practice of this invention utilize the serine protease of choice and short peptide substrates whose cleavage can be monitored, typically by simple colorimetric methods. For the purposes of this invention, the inhibitory activity of a compound when measured by Step (b) is considered to be significantly greater than the inhibitory activity of the compound when measured by Step (a) if the difference in the activity is such that one of ordinary skill in the art would consider it substantive in view of typical biological and experimental variablity. Typically, a significantly greater activity will mean at least a ten, preferably at least a one hundred and more preferably at least a one thousand, fold increase in inhibitory activity.	Preferred is a method for inhibiting a serine protease with a divalent metal cation selected from the group consisting of zinc and cobalt in a medium comprising the serine protease and the inhibitor, in which the inhibitor comprises two heteroatoms in spatial relationship one to the other so as to chelate zinc, which method comprises having sufficient quantity of the divalent metal cation in the medium or adding a sufficient amount of the divalent metal cation to the medium to have any or all of the inhibitor which is bound to the serine protease as a divalent metal cation ternary complex, or providing the inhibitor as a divalent metal cation binary complex, such that the divalent metal cation is bound between the inhibitor and the active site of the serine protease as a divalent metal cation ternary complex; more preferably wherein the two heteroatoms are annular members of a ring, particularly wherein at least one of the heteroatoms is an annular member of an benzimidazole ring, or wherein the inhibitor is provided as a zinc binary complex. Suitable zinc binary complexes of compounds can be prepared by combining the compound with a zinc concentration of at least 0.01 µM to 100 mM, typically 0.1 µM to 50 mM and preferably about 5 µM to 50 µM.	Preferred methods of this invention for inhibiting a serine protease with a serine protease inhibitor are those in which the amount of zinc included in the assay medium is at least equal to the concentration of the serine protease inhibitor.	Generally, the amount of zinc included in a preparation or medium containing the inhibitor will be at least 0.1 µM, typically to least 1 µM, more preferably 10 µM, and more preferably at least 100 µM. Typically, the zinc concentration employed will provide that at least about 80%, preferably at least about 90%, and more preferably substantially all of the inhibitor will be chelated with zinc. In	physiological systems, the amount of zinc present will normally be sufficient to provide zinc complexes.

WO1998022619_0004	The serine protease inhibitors useful in and identified by the practice of this invention, in association with a divalent metal cation or as a pre-associated binary complex with a divalent metal cation, form a divalent metal cation ternary complex with the active site residues of the serine protease and thereby inhibits its activity. The serine protease inhibitors useful in and identified by the practice of this invention comprise (a) a chemical functional group which occupies the P1 site on the target serine protease and (b) a structurally adjacent bidentate chelator which captures the divalent cation into a tetrahedral complex involving side chains of His57 and Ser195 of the catalytic site of the enzyme. The combination of P1 binding and bidentate chelation properties in a single composition provides a synergistic effect for serine protease inhibition at physiological levels of divalent cations like zinc. For example, benzamidine (Compound 3) and benzylamine (Compound 5), which each have a typical P1 recognition element, are weak inhibitors of the serine protease trypssn. Similarly, 2-pyrid-2-ylbenzimidazole (Compound 9), which comprises a typical zinc sequestering element, produces no inhibition of trypsin. However, 5-amidino-2-pyrid-2-yl-benzimidazole (Compound 10), which comprises the structural combination of the typical P1 binding and zinc sequestering elements, is a potent inhibitor of trypsin. Thus, the serine protease inhibitors useful in and identified by the practice of this invention meet the above-described structural requirements if the value of the Ki (Zinc removed) » Ki (Zinc added), indicating inhibition is potentiated in the presence of zinc. Accordingly, the methods and compositions of this invention are useful for in vitro and in vivo inhibition of serine proteases and for the screening for and the identification of serine protease inhibitors and for protecting peptides and proteins from proteolytic degradation.	X-ray crystallography of the inhibitor-zinc-serine protease complexes have and can be obtained using contemporary biophysical methodologies and commercial instrumentation. Such crystallographic data have and can be used to conclusively determine if a serine protease inhibitor has the structural requirements necessary for zinc potentiation of serine protease inhibition. An example of such an X-ray crystallographic determination is presented below.	Serine protease enzymes of interest include, but are not limited to, trypsin-like enzymes, such as trypsin, plasm kallikrein, tissue kallikrein, plasmin, thrombin and tryptase; chymotrypsin-like enzymes, including chymotrypsin, cathepsin G. and chymase; elastase-like enzymes, including neutrophil elastase and elastase; and carboxypeptidase-like enzymes. These enzymes play a role in apoptosis, blood pressure regulation, cancer, cardiovascular function, blood clotting, lysis, chemotaxis, development, digestion, fertilization, hormone processing, immune response, complement, infection: bacterial, viral and parasitic inflammation, mast cells, and other cells, neurologic, pain and protein secretion. Serine protease targets in medicine include for cardiovascular treatments: thrombin, factor Xa, factor Vila, and chymase; for infectious diseases involving parasites, viruses and bacteria:	cytomegalovirus protease and ß-lactamases, serine proteases specific for the pathogen; for bleeding, urokinase, activated protein C and tPA; for inflammation, tryptase, chymase, neutrophil elastase, plasm kallikrein and tissue kallikrein; and for neurobiology, serine proteases associated with Alzheimer's disease, to name only a few of the available targets.	The methods and compositions of this invention may be used in affinity columns to isolate serine proteases. Furthermore, because the serine protease inhibitors useful in the practice of this invention can vary as to their specificity toward serine proteases, the methods and compositions of this invention can be used to selectively isolate and purify serine proteases. In this regard, conventional techniques may be employed for linking the various compounds to supports, beads, macromolecules, and the like. Linking groups may include carboxyl groups, amino groups, thio groups, activated olefins, or the like. The linking group may be bonded to the inhibition moiety or the binding moiety. Surfaces of columns or capillaries may be employed as the affinity column or the column may be packed with a variety of beads, such as Sephadex, sepharose, latex beads, or the like. The particular manner in which the column is prepared is not critical to the practice to this invention. In addition, the columns may be used in assays for detecting the various serine proteases, by providing a binding profile which can be developed for the serine protease of interest, and determining relative K; values for libraries of inhibitors that utilize metal complexation as a mechanism of inhibition.	The serine protease inhibitors useful in and identified by the practice of this invention are themselves useful for the treatment of various diseases. For example, serine protease inhibitors can be used for the treatment of clinical arthritis, synovitis and associated pathologies (e.g. see U.S. Patent No. 4,940,723). The serine proteases useful in and identified by the practice of this invention also permit investigation of the physiological processes associated with a wide variety of biological events involving serine proteases. The advantage of being able to modulate serine protease activity by removing or adding zinc allows for the investigation on the effect of such activity in physiological processes.	Further, because the divalent metal cation-serine protease inhibitor complexes of this invention are able to form the inhibitor-cation-serine protease ternary complex without the necessity of having the concentration of zinc in the assay medium modified, the pre-associated cation-inhibitor complexes are useful in the practice the methods of this invention for identifying the inhibitory activity of the inhibitors. Similarly, the divalent metal cation-serine protease inhibitor complexes of this invention are useful in treating disease wherein the inhibitor is delivered to the target tissue locally (e.g., by topical application to the skin or eyes, by aerosol delivery to the lungs, etc.).	Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions:	In general, the divalent metal cation-serine protease inhibitor complexes of this invention and the serine protease inhibitors useful in and identified by the practice of this invention will be administered in therapeutically effective amounts via any of the usual and acceptable modes known in the art, either singly or in combination with another therapeutic agent. A therapeutically effective amount may vary widely depending on the severity of the disease, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used and other factors. For example, therapeutically effective amounts of a serine protease inhibitor or complexes thereof for the treatment of asthma may range from 0.1 micrograms per kilogram body weight (µg/kg) per day to 1 milligram per kilogram body weight (mg/kg) per day, typically 1 µg/kg/day to 0.1 mg/kg/day. Therefore, a therapeutically effective amount for a 80 kg asthmatic human patient may range from 10 µg/day to 10 mg/day, typically 0.1 mg/day to 10 mg/day.	In general, one of ordinary skill in the art, acting in reliance upon personal knowledge and the disclosure of this application, will be able to ascertain the therapeutically effective amounts of the serine protease inhibitors for treating a given disease.	Serine protease inhibitors can be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by one of the following routes: oral, systemic (e.g., transdermal, intranasal or by suppository) or parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous).	Compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, or any other appropriate composition and are comprised of, in general, a serine protease inhibitor in combination with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients are non-toxic, aid administration, and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the active ingredient. Such excipient may be any solid, liquid, semisolid or, in the case of an aerosol composition, gaseous excipient that is generally available to one of skill in the art.	Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, and the like. Liquid and semisolid excipients may be selected from water, ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol and various oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin (e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, etc.).	Preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions, include water, saline, aqueous dextrose and glycols.	Compressed gases may be used to disperse the active ingredient in aerosol form. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, etc. Other suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are described in A.R. Alfonso Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1985, 17th ed. Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Company.	The amount of a serine protease inhibitor or metal cation complex thereof in the composition may vary widely depending upon the type of formulation, size of a unit dosage, kind of excipients and other factors known to those of skill in the art of pharmaceutical sciences. In general, a composition of a serine protease or metal cation complex thereof will comprise from 0.01%w to 10%w, preferably 0.3%w to 1%w, of active ingredient with the remainder being the excipient or excipients. Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is administered in a single unit dosage form for continuous treatment or in a single unit dosage form ad libitum when relief of symptoms is specifically required.	Examples:	EXAMPLE 1	In Vitro Enzyme Inhibitor Assay	The following represents an assay for determining the serine protease inhibitory activity of a compound.	Step (a) - zinc removed	Mixtures of human trypsin (3.4 nM) and test compound (varying	concentrations) in assay medium (comprising: DMSO, 10%; polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (Tween-20), 0.05%; and EDTA; 1 mM; in buffered saline adjusted to pH 8.0) were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then substrate, N-tosyl-gly-pro-lys-pNA (Sigma #T6140, 0.5 mM in water), was added such that the final concentration of the assay mixture was 0.125 mM. Hydrolysis of the substrate was followed spectrophotometrically at (405 nm) for 5 minutes. Apparent inhibition constants (KJ were calculated from the enzyme progress curves using standard mathematical models.	Step (b) - zinc modified	The assay protocol for determination of inhibition in the presence of zinc is conducted under essentially equivalent assay conditions to that used for Part (a), with the exception that the assay medium does not contain EDTA and is modified to 150 µM zinc chloride in the form of a stock solution of 100 mM.	Step (c) - zinc ambient	The assay protocol for determination of inhibition at ambient levels of zinc is conducted under essentially equivalent assay conditions to that used in Part (a), with the exception that the assay medium does not contain EDTA.	Proceeding as in Example 1, compounds of Formula I were tested for their inhibitory activity toward activated protein C, chymase, chymotrypsin, factor Xa, factor Vila, plasm kallikrein, tissue kallikrein, ß-lactamase, plasmin, thrombin, trypsin, tryptase and urokinase. Compounds of Formula I were identified for each protease wherein the inhibitory activity of the compound when measured by Step (b) was at least 101, typically 102 to 103, times greater than the inhibitory activity of the compound when measured by Step (a).	Proceeding as in Example 1, Part (b), but varying the zinc concentration in the medium from 10-9M to 10-4M, assays were performed which demonstrated that the minimum zinc concentration found to maximally enhance the inhibitory activity of a compound was between 0.1 and 1 µM.	EXAMPLE 2	In Vitro Enzyme Inhibitor Assay	The following represents an assay for determining the serine protease inhibitory activity of a compound in the presence of a metal buffering agent.	Part (a) - zinc removed	Mixtures of cytomegalovirus (CMV) protease (50 nM) and test compound (varying concentrations) in assay buffer (comprising: HEPES, 50 mM; NaCl, 150 mM, PEG 3350, 0.01%, Sucrose, 30%, oxalate, 4.5 mM; adjusted to pH 7.5) were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature and then substrate, dabsyl-arg-gly-val-val-asn-ala-ser-ser-arg-leu-ala-lys-lsy-dansyl (4 mM in water), was added such that the final concentration of the assay mixture was 10 µM. Hydrolysis of the substrate was followed fluorometrically (ex 355 nm, em 510 ran) for approximately	15 minutes. Apparent inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from the enzyme progress curves using standard mathematical models.	Part (b) - zinc modified	The assay protocol for determination of inhibition in the presence of zinc is conducted under essentially equivalent assay conditions to that used for Part (a), with the exception that the assay is modified to 10 µM zinc.	Proceeding as in Example 2, compounds of Formula I were tested for their inhibitory activity toward CMV protease. Compounds of Formula I were identified wherein the inhibitory activity toward CMV protease when measured by Step (b) was 30 to 102 times greater than the inhibitory activity of the compound when measured by Step (a).	Proceeding as in Example 2, Pan (b). but substituting trypsin for CMV protease and varying the zinc concentration in the medium from 1×10-9M to 1×10-4M, assays were performed which demonstrated that the minimum zinc concentration needed to maximally enhance the inhibitory activity of a serine protease inhibitor was between 0.1 and 1 µM.	EXAMPLE 3	X-Ray Crystallography of Serine Protease-Zinc-Protease Complex	Crystals of Compound 3-trypsin were grown using MgST)4 as the precipitant in 100 mM Tris, pH 8.2 by the batch 5 method of M.Krieger, L. M. Kay and R. Stroud, J. Mol. Biol. 83: 209-230(1974). Compound 1-trypsin could not be crystallized de novo, nor with seeding with Compound 3-trypsin crystals. Initial attempts to soak Compound 1 into these crystals at pH 8.2 were unsuccessful because of limited solubility and stability of Compound 1 at this pH in MgSO4-containing synthetic mother liquor. Moreover, in Tris buffer alone at pH 8.2	Compound 1 turns yellow within an hour, and after many hours begins to precipitate. In MES buffer at pH 5.9 this transformation does not occur after several weeks. The solubility of Compound 1 freshly dissolved in synthetic mother liquor containing 415 mg/ml MgSO4, 100 mM Tris, pH 8.2 or 415 mg/ml MgSO4, 100 mM MES, pH 5.9 was determined to be ~100 mM.	Crystals of Compound 1-trypsin (pH 5.9) were first prepared successfully by soaking Compound 3-trypsin crystals in freshly dissolved Compound 1 in synthetic mother liquor at saturation at pH 5.9. The soaks were replaced with fresh ones 4 times, about once a day. Crystals of Compound 1-trypsin (pH 8.2) were successfully prepared by soaking Compound 3-trypsin crystals in freshly dissolved Compound 1 in synthetic mother liquor at saturation at pH 8.2 containing 0.1 mM ZnSO4. The soaks were replaced with fresh ones 5 times, about once a day. Significant amounts of yellow precipitate formed in the soaking solutions after a day.	Individual Ihkl data were collected for Compound 3-trypsin (pH 8.2),	Compound 1-trypsin (pH 5.9) and Zn+2-Compound 1-trypsin (pH 8.2) on a Siemens Multiwire Area Detector or on an image plate detector (R-axis-II (Rigaku	Corporation)).Data were extracted using the XDS programs of Kabsch, or the software provided by the Macromolecular Structure Corporation, (The Woodlands, Texas), and an indexing program. Data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 2.	For the refinement of Compound 3-trypsin, the highly refined MlP-trypsin structure served as a template. Water molecules outside the active site region in the MIP X-ray and neutron structures were included in the initial phasing model. The structure was refined using alternating cycles of(?Fo?-Fc?), ac and (2?Fo?-?Fc?), ac difference maps (J.L.Chambers & R. Stroud, Acta Cryst. B35: 1861-1875 (1979), and automated least squares refinement with XPLOR (Brunger). Difference Fourier maps were computed between Compound 3- trypsin (pH 8.2) and Compound 1-trypsin (pH 5.9) or Zn+2-Compound 1-trypsin (pH 8.2)to yield initial structures which were then likewise refined.	The (2?Fo?-?Fc?), ac difference map for Compound 1-trypsin at pH 5.9 clearly shows one amidinobenzimidazole group of Compound 1 occupying the P1 pocket. The Compound 3 portion of it closely overlays that for Compound 3 in the	Compound 3-trypsin structure. At pH 8.2, the (?Fo?-?Fc?), ac and (2?Fo?-?Fc?), ac maps for the Zn+2-Compound 1-trypsin complex clearly reveal the position and orientation of Compound 1 as well as a strong peak (13 s in the (?Fo?-?Fc?),ac map) which corresponds to the position of the Zn+2 ion coordinating two of the imidazole nitrogens of Compound 1, the imidazole of His57 and the O? atom of Serl95. Thus the nanomolar binding constant of Compound 1 is achieved with the synergy of Zn+2 at concentrations of this metal at lower than 100 nM. Bond distances involving the Zn+2 ion, are similar to those observed in other Zn+2-containing proteins. The average of 5 ligand-Zn+2-ligand angles is 114(11)°, but the 6th angle, involving the	
WO1998022619_0005	Compound 1 ligand alone (N3-Zn+2-N3') is only 81°. The Compound 1 molecule pivots to an altered position in the structure of trypsin-Compound 1-Zn+2 at pH 8.2, to allow the benzimidazoles of Compound 1 to form part of the Zn+2 binding site. The pivoting causes an insignificant change in the position of the amidine group in the P1 pocket, but a large shift (~5 Å) in the position of the other amidine group. An NH group of one terminal amidine nitrogen interacts with main chain carbonyl 41 through bridging hydrogen bonds, while another NH group of the other terminal amidine nitrogen forms a direct hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl 244 of a symmetry related molecule.	TABLE 2	The following table represents the results of the Crystallography of Trypsin- Compound 3, Trypsin-Compound 1-SO4-2' pH 5.9, and Trypsin-Compound 1-Zn+2, pH 8.2.	It is evident from the above results, that by using metal cation complexes, particularly zinc, or metal cation complexes involving, particularly zinc, in combination with compounds comprising a P site binding moiety and a metal cation chelating moiety, which compounds can fit at the active site, extremely active serine protease inhibitors can be produced. By modifying the P site binding moiety, the chelating compounds can be directed to a variety of different serine proteases with high specificity. In this manner, one may inhibit serine protease activity in vitro and in vivo, in studying physiological processes, in preventing degradation of proteins which are specific substrates of serine proteases, in inhibiting bacteriological action, and in treating a variety of indications, where the pathology is associated with active serine proteases.

Publication Language: English (EN)	Filing Language: English (EN)	Therapeutic Agents	Field of the invention	The present invention relates to certain novel benzoic acid derivatives, to processes for preparing such compounds, to their utility in treating clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance, to methods for their therapeutic use and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.	Background of the invention	The Insulin Resistance Syndrome (LRS) including type 2 diabetes mellitus, which refers to a cluster of manifestations including insulin resistance with accompanying	hyperinsulinaemia, possible type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, central (visceral) obesity, dyslipidaemia observed as deranged lipoprotein levels typically characterised by elevated VLDL (very low density lipoproteins), small dense LDL particles and reduced HDL (high density lipoprotein) concentrations and reduced fibrinolysis.	Recent epidemiological research has documented that individuals with insulin resistance run a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, notably suffering from myocardial infarction and stroke. In type 2 diabetes mellitus atherosclerosis related conditions cause up to 80% of all deaths.	In clinical medicine there is awareness of the need to increase the msulin sensitivity in IRS suffering patients and thus to correct the dyslipidaemia which is considered to cause the accelerated progress of atherosclerosis. However, currently this is not a universally well defined disease.	The S-enantiomer of the compound of formula C below	2-ethoxy-3-[4-(2-{4-methanesulfonyloxyphenyl}ethoxy)phenyl]propanoic acid, is disclosed in PCT Publication Number WO99/62872. This compound is reported to be a modulator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR, for a review of the PPARs see T. M.Willson et al , J Med Chem 2000, Vol 43, 527) and has combined PPAR /PPAR? agonist activity (Structure, 2001, Vol 9, 699, P. Cronet et al). This compound is effective in treating conditions associated with insulin resistance.	Surprisingly a series of compounds has now been found which are selective PPARa modulators.	Description of the invention	The present invention provides a compound of formula I	wherein n is 0, 1 or 2;	R1 represents halo, a C1-4alkyl group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro, a C1- alkoxy group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro and wherein when n is 2 the substituents R1 may be the same or different;	R2 represents an unbranched C2-7alkyl group;	R3 represents H or OCH3; and	W represents O or S	and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof.	Further values of R1, R2, R3 and in compounds of Formula I now follow. It will be understood that such values may be used with any of the definitions, claims or	embodiments defined hereinbefore or hereinafter.	In a first aspect R1 is halo, a	group and n is 0, 1 or 2.	Particularly R1 is fluoro, chloro or trifluoromethyl when n is 1. Particularly R1 is fluoro when n is 2.	In a second aspect R2 represents ethyl or hexyl.	
WO2004000294_0002	In a third aspect R3 represents H.	In a fourth aspect R3 represents OMe.	In a fifth aspect W represents O.	In a sixth aspect W represents S.	The term unbranched Q^alkyl denotes a straight-chain, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon having from 2 to 7 carbon atoms. Examples of said alkyl include ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n- pentyl, n-hexyl and n- heptyl.	It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the term interrupted as used above means that the oxygen atom is situated witliin the alkyl chain and is not the terminal atom. The term "prodrug " as used in this specification includes derivatives of the carboxylic acid group which are converted in a mammal, particularly a human, into the carboxylic acid group or a salt or conjugate thereof. It should be understood that, whilst not being bound by theory, it is believed that most of the activity associated with the prodrugs arises from the activity of the compound of formula I into which the prodrugs are converted. Prodrugs can be prepared by routine methodology well within the capabilities of someone skilled in the art. Various prodrugs of carboxy are known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see:	a) Design of Prodrugs, edited by H. Bundgaard, (Elsevier, 1985) and Methods in	Enzymology. 42: 309-396, edited by K. Widder, et al. (Academic Press, 1985); b) A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, edited by Krogsgaard-Larsen and	H. Bundgaard, Chapter 5 "Design and Application of Prodrugs", by H. Bundgaard p.113-191 (1991);	c) H. Bundgaard, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 8: 1-38 (1992);	d) H. Bundgaard, et al, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 77:285 (1988); and e) N. Kakeya, et al, Chem Pharm Bull, 32:692 (1984).	The above documents a to e are herein incorporated by reference.	In vivo cleavable esters are just one type of prodrug of the parent molecule.	The compounds of formula I have activity as medicaments, in particular the compounds of formula I are selective agonists of PPAR , that is, their EC50 for PPARa is at least four times lower and preferably at least 10 or 50 times lower than their respective ECsofor PPAR? wherein the EC50S are measured and calculated as described in the assays later in this document. The compounds of formula I are potent and selective.

Particularly the compound is selected from:	2-[2-(4-{2-[emyl(2-fluorobenzyl)amino]-2-oxoethoxy}phenyl)ethoxy]benzoic acid;	2-[2-(4-{2-[(4-cMorobenzyl)(e yl)amino]-2-oxoethoxy}phenyl)ethylthio]benzoic acid; 2-[2-(4-{2-[(2,4-dMuorobenzyl)(propyl)amino]-2-oxoelhoxy}phenyl)ethoxy]benzoic acid; 2-[2-(4-{2-[^enzyl(emyl)an?ino]-2-oxoethoxy}phenyl)ethoxy]benzoic acid; or	2-[2-(4-{2-[ethyl(4-fluorobenzyl)amino]-2-oxoethoxy}phenyl)ethoxy]benzoic acid;	It will also be understood that certain compounds of the present invention may exist in solvated, as well as unsolvated forms.

Isomers may be separated using conventional techniques, e.g. chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The	enantiomers may be isolated by separation of racemate for example by fractional crystallisation, resolution or HPLC. The diastereomers may be isolated by separation of isomer mixtures for instance by fractional crystallisation, HPLC or flash chromatography. Alternatively the stereoisomers may be made by chiral synthesis from chiral starting materials under conditions which will not cause racemisation or epimerisation, or by derivatisation, with a chiral reagent. All stereoisomers are included within the scope of the invention.	Methods of preparation	The compounds of the invention may be prepared as outlined below. However, the invention is not limited to these methods, the compounds may also be prepared as described for stmcturally related compounds in the prior art.

Compounds of formula II may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V	in which PG is as previously defined with a compound of formula VI	VI	in which R1, R2, R3,W and n are as previously defined and L represents a leaving group, for example methylsulphonyloxy or halo, e.g. bromo, optionally in the presence of solvent, for example acetonitrilie, and optionally in the presence of a base, for example potassium carbonate, at a temperature in the range of 0 to 150°C.	Compounds of formula III , IV, V and VI may be prepared by methods described in the Examples or by analogous methods known to those skilled in the art.	
WO2004000294_0003	Compounds of formula II, III , IV and V are useful intermediates in the preparation of compounds of formula I. Certain of these compounds are believed to be novel. Novel compounds of formula II, or formula III, or formula IV or formula V are herein claimed as a further aspect of the present invention.	The compounds of the invention may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques.	Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that, in order to obtain compounds of the invention in an alternative and in some occasions, more convenient manner, the individual process steps mentioned hereinbefore may be performed in different order, and/or the individual reactions may be performed at different stage in the overall route (i.e. chemical	transformations may be performed upon different intermediates to those associated hereinbefore with a particular reaction).	In any of the preceding methods of preparation, where necessary, hydroxy, amino or other reactive groups may be protected using a protecting group, R as described in the standard text "Protective groups in Organic Synthesis", 2 Edition (1991) by Greene and Wuts. The protecting group may also be a resin, such as Wang resin or 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin. The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after any of the reaction steps described hereinbefore. Protecting groups may be removed in accordance to techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art.	The expression "inert solvent" refers to a solvent which does not react with the starting materials, reagents, intermediates or products in a manner which adversely affects the yield of the desired product.

Pharmacological properties	The present compounds of formula (I) are useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of clinical conditions associated with inherent or induced reduced sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance) and associated metabolic disorders (also known as metabohc syndrome). These clinical conditions will include, but will not be limited to, general obesity, abdominal obesity, arterial hypertension, hypermsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, type 2 diabetes and the dyslipidaemia characteristically appearing with msulin resistance. This dyslipidaemia, also known as the atherogenic lipoprotein profile, is characterised by moderately elevated non-esterified fatty acids, elevated very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride rich particles, high Apo B levels, low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels associated with low apoAI particle levels and high Apo B levels in the presence of small, dense, low density lipoproteins (LDL) particles, phenotype B.	The compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in treating patients with combined or mixed hyperlipidemias or various degrees of hypertriglyceridemias and postprandial dyslipidemia with or without other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome.	Treatment with the present compounds is expected to lower the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerosis due to their antidyslipidaemic as well as antiinflammatory properties. The cardiovascular disease conditions include macro-angiopathies of various internal organs causing myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities. Because of their insulin sensitizing effect the compounds of formula I are also expected to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes from the metabohc syndrome and diabetes of pregnancy. Therefore the development of long-term	complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia in diabetes mellitus such as the micro-angiopathies causing renal disease, retinal damage and peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs are expected to be delayed. Furthermore the compounds may be useful in treatment of various conditions outside the cardiovascular system whether or not associated with insulin resistance, like polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, cancer and states of inflammatory disease including neurodegenerative disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.	The compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in controlling glucose levels in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes.	The present invention provides a method of treating or preventing dyslipidemias, the insulin resistance syndrome and/or metabohc disorders (as defined above) comprising the administration of a compound of formula I to a mammal (particularly a human) in need thereof.	The present invention provides a method of treating or preventing type 2 diabetes comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula I to a mammal (particularly a human) in need thereof.	In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula I as a medicament.	In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula I in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of insulin resistance and/or metabolic disorders.	Combination Therapy The compounds of the invention may be combined with another therapeutic agent that is useful in the treatment of disorders associated with the development and progress of atherosclerosis such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemias, dyshpidaemias, diabetes and obesity. The compounds of the invention may be combined with another therapeutic agent that decreases the ratio of LDL:HDL or an agent that causes a decrease in circulating levels of LDL-cholesterol. In patients with diabetes mellitus the compounds of the invention may also be combined with therapeutic agents used to treat complications related to micro-angiopathies.	The compounds of the invention may be used alongside other therapies for the treatment of metabohc syndrome or type 2 diabetes and its associated complications, these include biguanide drugs, for example metformin, phenformin and buformin, insulin (synthetic insulin analogues, amylin) and oral antihyperglycemics (these are divided into prandial glucose regulators and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors). An example of an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor is acarbose or voghbose or miglitol. An example of a prandial glucose regulator is repaglinide or nateglinide.	In another aspect of the invention, the compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, solvate of such a salt or a prodrug thereof, may be administered in association with another PPAR modulating agent. PPAR modulating agents include but are not limited to a PPAR alpha and/or gamma and /or delta agonist, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, solvates of such salts or prodrugs thereof. Suitable PPAR alpha and/or gamma agonists, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, solvates of such salts or prodrugs thereof are well known in the art. These include the compounds described in WO 01/12187, WO 01/12612, WO 99/62870, WO 99/62872, WO 99/62871, WO	98/57941, WO 01/40170, J Med Chem, 1996, 39, 665, Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents, 10 (5), 623-634 (in particular the compounds described in the patent applications listed on page 634) and J Med Chem, 2000, 43, 527 which are all incorporated herein by reference.

Biological activity	Formulations	Compounds were dissolved in DMSO to obtain 16 mM stock solutions. Before assays, stock solutions were further diluted in DMSO and culture media.	GENERAL CHEMICALS AND REAGENTS	Luciferase assay reagent was purchased from Packard, USA. Restriction Enzymes were from Boehringer and Vent polymerase from New England Biolabs.	CELL LINES AND CELL CULTURE CONDITIONS	U2-OS, (Osteogenic sarcoma, Human) was purchased from ATCC, USA. Cells were expanded and refrozen in batches from passage number six. Cells were cultured in	Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 25 mM glucose, 2 mM glutamine or 4 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine,10% fetal calf serum, at 5% CO2. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without addition of calcium or magnesium was used. All cell culture reagents were from Gibco (USA) and 96- well cell culture plates were purchased from Wallach PLASMID CONSTRUCTS FOR HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION	Standard recombinant DNA techniques were carried out as described by Ausubel (7). The Luciferase reporter vector, pGL5UAS (clone consists of five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding sequence, 5'-CGACGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAGCT-3', cloned into the	Sacl/Xhol sites of pGL3-Promoter (Promega). The Sacl/Xhol fragment carrying the UAS sites was constructed using annealed overlapping oligonucleotides.	Expression vectors used are based upon pSG5 (Stratagene). All vectors contain an	EcoRI/Nhel fragment encoding the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (encoding amino acid positions 1- 145 of database accession number P04386) followed by an in-frame fusion to a fragment encoding the nuclear locahsation sequence fromT antigen of Pofyoma Virus. The nuclear locahsation sequence was constructed using annealed overlapping	oligonucleotides creating Nhel Kpnl sticky ends	(5'-CTAGCGCTCCTAGAAGAAACGCAAGGTTGGTAC-3'). The ligand binding domains from human and mouse PPARa and human and mouse PPAR? were PCR amplified as Kpnl/BamHI fragments and cloned in frame to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the nuclear locahsation sequence. The sequence of all plasmid constructs used were confirmed by sequencing.	The following expression vectors were used for transient transfections:	1 refers to nucleotide positions of data base entry used to express the ligand binding domain.	TRANSIENT TRANSFECTIONS	
WO2004000294_0009	Frozen stocks of cells from passage number six were thawed and expanded to passage number eight before transfections. Confluent cells were trypsinised, washed and pelleted by centrifugation at 270xg for 2 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold PBS to a cell concentration of about 18 x 106 cells/ml. After addition of DNA, the cell suspension was incubated on ice for approximately 5 minutes before electroporation at 230 V, 960 µF in Biorad' s Gene Pulser™ in 0.5 ml batches. A total of 50 µg DNA was added to each batch of 0.5 ml cells, including 2.5 µg expression vector, 25 µg reporter vector and 22.5 µg unspecific DNA (pBluescript, Stratagene).	After electroporation, cells were diluted to a concentration of 320O00 cells/ml in DMEM without phenol red, and approximately 25 '000 cells/well were seeded in 96- well plates. In order to allow cells to recover, seeded plates were incubated at 37°C for 3-4 hours before addition of test compounds. In assays for PPARa, the cell medium was supplemented with resin-charcoal stripped fetal calf serum (FCS) in order to avoid background activation by fatty acid components of the FCS. The resin-charcoal stripped FCS was produced as follows; for 500 ml of heat- inactivated FCS, 10 g charcoal and 25 g Bio-Rad Analytical Grade Anion Exchange Resin 200-400 mesh were added, and the solution was kept on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature over night. The following day, the FCS was centtifuged and the stripping procedure was repeated for 4-6 hours. After the second treatment, the FCS was centrifuged and filter sterilised in order to remove remnants of charcoal and resin.	ASSAY PROCEDURE	Stock solutions of compounds in DMSO were diluted in appropriate concentration ranges in master plates. From master plates, compounds were diluted in culture media to obtain test compound solutions for final doses.	After adjustment of the amount of cell medium to 75 µl in each well, 50 µl test compound solution was added. Transiently transfected cells were exposed to compounds for about 24 hours before the luciferase detection assay was performed. For luciferase assays, 100 µl of assay reagent was added manually to each well and plates were left for approximately 20 minutes in order to allow lysis of the cells. After lysis, luciferase activity was measured in a 1420 Multiwell counter, Victor, from Wallach.	Reference compounds	The TZD pioghtazone was used as reference substance for activation of both human and murine PPAR?. 5,8,11, 14-Eicosatetrayonic acid (ETYA) was used as reference substance for human PPARa.	Calculations and analysis	For calculation of EC50 values, a concentration-effect curve was established. Values used were derived from the average of two or tliree independent measurements (after subtraction of the background average value) and were expressed as the percentage of the maximal activation obtained by the reference compound. Values were plotted against the logarithm of the test compound concentration. EC50 values were estimated by linear intercalation between the data points and calculating the concentration required to achieve 50% of the maximal activation obtained by the reference compound.	The compounds of formula I have an EC50 of less than 50µmol/l for PPARa and preferred compounds have an EC50 of less than 5µmol/l.

Such as, for example, the term pyridyl or pyridinyl, alone or as part of another group, includes pyridin- 2-yl, pyridin-3-yl and pyridin-4-yl; or 1 N-(R33)-piperidinyl includes 1 N-(R33)-piperidin-2-yl, 1 N-(R33)-piperidin-3-yl and 1 N-(R33)-piperidin-4-yl.	1 N-(R33)-Piperidinyl stands for a piperidinyl radical which is substituted by R33 at the nitrogen atom, such as, for example, any radical, which is selected from the group consisting of piperidin-2-yl, piperidin-3-yl and piperidin-4-yl, and which is substituted by R33 at its nitrogen atom.	4N-(R322)-Piperazin-1-yl stands for a piperazin-1-yl radical which is substituted at its nitrogen atom in the 4-position by R322.	4N-(1-4C-Alkyl)-piperazin-1-yl stands for a piperazin-1-yl radical which is substituted at its nitrogen atom in the 4-position by one of the abovementioned 1-4C-alkyl radicals, such as e.g. 4N-methyl-piperazin-1-yl.	2-(R41)-Ethyl stands for an ethyl radical substituted in 2-position by R41.	In the meaning of the present invention, it is to be understood, that, when two structural portions of the compounds according to this invention are linked via a constituent which has the meaning "bond", then said two portions are directly attached to another via a single bond.	Constituents which are substituted as stated herein, may be substituted, unless otherwise noted, at any possible position.	The substituent R2 of compounds of formula I can be attached in the ortho, meta or para position with respect to the binding position in which the phenyl ring is bonded to the amino group, whereby preference is given to the attachement in the meta or, particularly, para position.	When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent, each definition is independent.	Suitable salts for compounds according to this invention - depending on substitution - are all acid addition salts or all salts with bases. Particular mention may be made of the pharmacologically tolerable inorganic and organic acids and bases customarily used in pharmacy. Those suitable are, on the one hand, water-insoluble and, particularly, water-soluble acid addition salts with acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, D-gluconic acid, benzoic acid, 2-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, butyric acid,	sulphosalicylic acid, maleic acid, lauric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, embonic acid, stearic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid or 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, the acids being employed in salt preparation - depending on whether a mono- or polybasic acid is concerned and depending on which salt is desired - in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom.	On the other hand, salts with bases are - depending on substitution - also suitable. As examples of salts with bases are mentioned the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, magnesium, titanium, ammonium, meglumine or guanidinium salts, here, too, the bases being employed in salt preparation in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom.

Said nucleophilic substitution reaction can be carried out as described in the following examples or as known to the skilled person; thus, depending on the reactivity of the reactants, it can be carried out by melting the reaction partners without solvent together or by reacting the reaction partners in a suitable solvent, such as e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide, in the presence of a suitable base, such as e.g. sodium hydride or potassium carbonate, at a temperature to allow the reaction to procede (this may be e.g., depending on the reactants, ambient temperature, elevated temperature, or reflux temperature of the solvent used or, under appropriate conditions, beyond it), optionally under microwave irradiation. Compounds of formula III are known or can be obtained in a known manner.	Compounds of formula Il can be obtained as described later herein.

Alternatively, compounds of the formula Ia' can also be prepared from the corresponding compounds of formula Ia and corresponding compounds of formula R3-C(O)Y, in which Y is hydroxyl, by reaction with amide bond linking reagents known to the person skilled in the art under conditions customary to the skilled person.

Reaction scheme 2	Compounds of formula R3-C(O)Y are known or can be obtained in a known manner.	Compounds of formula Ia can be obtained directly as shown in reaction scheme 1 and described above by using diaminobenzene; or they are accessible by reduction of the nitro group of compounds of formula I, in which R1 has the meanings mentioned above and R2 is nitro, with the aid of an appropriate reducing agent, such as e.g. tin dichloride.	Compounds of formula I, in which R1 has the meanings mentioned above and R2 is nitro, can be obtained according to reaction scheme 1.

Benzoic acids of formula Ib, in which R1 has the meanings given above, can be prepared by saponification of corresponding ester compounds of formula I, in which R2 is 1-4C-alkoxycarbonyl, particularly methoxycarbonyl.	Compounds of formula I, in which R1 has the meanings mentioned above and R2 is 1-4C-alkoxycarbonyl, particularly methoxycarbonyl, can be obtained according to reaction scheme 1.	Starting compounds of formula Il can be obtained as shown in reaction scheme 4 or as specified in the following examples; or they are art-known, such as e.g. from R. W. Carling et al., J. Med. Chem. Vol. 47, No. 7, 1807-1822 (2004), or they can be prepared according to known procedures or analogously or similarly to art-described compounds.	Reaction scheme 4 condensation	Compounds of formula II, in which R1 has the meanings mentioned above and X is a suitable leaving group, particularly chlorine, can be obtained from corresponding compounds of formula IV either in one step by cyclization reaction with corresponding compounds of formula RI-C(O)Z, in which Z is a suitable leaving group, such as e.g. chlorine; or in two steps via the isolatable intermediate of formula III, which is accessible by acylation of compounds of formula IV and which can be further reacted to desired compounds of formula Il by condensation reaction.	Said reactions can be carried out as described in the following examples, or under conditions known to the skilled person or analogously to art-known reactions similar thereto. Thus, the aforementioned one-step cyclization reaction can be carried out similarly as described in J. Med. Chem. Vol. 31 , 1988, p. 1115, in a suitable solvent, such as e.g. toluene, pyridine or dioxane, in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. triethylamine) at elevated temperature or the reflux temperature of the solvent used.	Compounds of formula IV can be obtained by nucleophilic substitution of compounds of formula V, in which X and X' can be the same and are suitable leaving groups, particularly X and X' are both chlorine, and hydrazine.	Compounds of formulae RI-C(O)Z and V are known or can be obtained in a known manner.	It is to be understood for the skilled worker, that certain compounds of formula I according to this invention can be converted into further compounds of formula I by art-known synthesis strategies and reactions habitual per se to a person of ordinary skill in the art, like e.g. as described above.	It is moreover known to the person skilled in the art that if there are a number of reactive centers on a starting or intermediate compound it may be necessary to block one or more reactive centers temporarily by protective groups in order to allow a reaction to proceed specifically at the desired reaction center. A detailed description for the use of a large number of proven protective groups is found, for example, in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by T. Greene and P. Wuts (John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1999, 3rd Ed.) or in "Protecting Groups (Thieme Foundations Organic Chemistry Series N Group" by P. Kocienski (Thieme Medical Publishers, 2000).	The substances of formula I according to the invention are isolated and purified in a manner known per se, for example by distilling off the solvent under reduced pressure and recrystallizing the residue obtained from a suitable solvent or subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as, for example, column chromatography on a suitable support material.	Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (e.g. a ketone, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone, an ether, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low-molecular-weight aliphatic alcohol, such as ethanol or isopropanol) which contains the desired acid or base, or to which the desired acid or base is then added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a nonsolvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted into the free compounds, which can in turn be converted into salts, by alkalization or by acidification. In this manner, pharmacologically unacceptable salts can be converted into	pharmacologically acceptable salts.	Suitably, the conversions mentioned in this invention can be carried out analogously or similarly to methods which are familiar per se to the person skilled in the art.	The person skilled in the art knows on the basis of his/her knowledge and on the basis of those synthesis routes, which are shown and described within the description of this invention, how to find other possible synthesis routes for compounds of formula I. All these other possible synthesis routes are also part of this invention.

As will be apparent to persons skilled in the art, modifications, analogies, variations, derivations, homologisations and adaptations to the described invention can be made on the base of art-known knowledge and/or, particularly, on the base of the disclosure (e.g. the explicite, implicite or inherent disclosure) of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention as defined by the appended claims.	The following examples serve to illustrate the invention further without restricting it. Likewise, further compounds of formula I, whose preparation is not explicitly described, can be prepared in an analogous or similar manner or in a manner familiar per se to the person skilled in the art using customary process techniques.

As selective inhibitors of cyclic GMP-hydrolysing phosphodiesterases (cGMP-PDE inhibitors) - prefentially of type 2 -, they are suitable on the one hand as therapeutics for conditions of pathologically enhanced endothelial activity and impaired endothelial barrier function such as septic shock, vascular edema, or diseases associated with unwanted neoangiogenesis. On the other hand, given the expression of PDE2 in neuronal tissue the compounds may also be useful in neurodegenerative conditions. In addition, PDE2 is expressed in human platelets and PDE2 inhibitors were shown to suppress platelet functions.

WO2006024640_0013	The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by processes which are known per se and familiar to the person skilled in the art. As pharmaceutical compositions, the compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are either employed as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries and/or excipients, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, caplets, suppositories, patches (e.g. as TTS), emulsions, suspensions, gels or solutions, the active compound content advantageously being between 0.1 and 95% and where, by the appropriate choice of the auxiliaries and/or excipients, a pharmaceutical administration form (e.g. a delayed release form or an enteric form) exactly suited to the active compound and/or to the desired onset of action can be achieved.	The person skilled in the art is familiar with auxiliaries or excipients which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations on account of his/her expert knowledge. In addition to solvents, gel formers, ointment bases and other active compound excipients, for example antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, preservatives, solubilizers, colorants, complexing agents or permeation promoters, can be used.	For the treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, the compounds according to the invention are preferably also administered by inhalation in the form of an aerosol; the aerosol particles of solid, liquid or mixed composition preferably having a diameter of 0.5 to 10 μm, advantageously of 2 to 6 μm.	Aerosol generation can be carried out, for example, by pressure-driven jet atomizers or ultrasonic atomizers, but advantageously by propellant-driven metered aerosols or propellant-free administration of micronized active compounds from inhalation capsules.	Depending on the inhaler system used, in addition to the active compounds the administration forms additionally contain the required excipients, such as, for example, propellants (e.g. Frigen in the case of metered aerosols), surface-active substances, emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives, flavorings, fillers (e.g. lactose in the case of powder inhalers) or, if appropriate, further active compounds.	For the purposes of inhalation, a large number of apparatuses are available with which aerosols of optimum particle size can be generated and administered, using an inhalation technique which is as right as possible for the patient. In addition to the use of adaptors (spacers, expanders) and pear-shaped containers (e.g. Nebulator®, Volumatic®), and automatic devices emitting a puffer spray (Autohaler®), for metered aerosols, in particular in the case of powder inhalers, a number of technical solutions are available (e.g. Diskhaler®, Rotadisk®, Turbohaler® or the inhaler described in European Patent Application EP 0 505 321), using which an optimal administration of active compound can be achieved.

General methods for cloning recombinant PDEs	RNA was purified from cell lines using the RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen. 1 μg RNA was reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA in a 20 μl reaction using Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche) with 5OpM of primer (dT)15 and 1 mM dNTPs (both from Roche). 5 μl of cDNA were used as template for the subsequent PCR reaction. Human cDNAs from tissues were purchased from Clontech or Invitrogen. 1 μl was used for PCR reaction.	PCR was carried out in a Stratagene Robocycler 40 or in a MWG Primus 96 plus thermocycler.	Typically, PCR was carried out with the Expand Lond Template PCR System from Roche in buffer 3 plus 0.75 mM MgCI2, 0.3 μM each primer, 500 μM dNTPs.	PCR products were purified with the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche) or from agarose gel with the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit from Qiagen, and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector from Invitrogen. The ORFs were subcloned in baculovirus expression vectors (transfer plasmids). The pCR-Bac and pVL vectors were from Invitrogen. The pBacPak vectors (pBP8 or pBP9) were from Clontech. Restriction endonucleases were from Roche and MBI Fermentas. Modifying enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs. DNA was sequenced by the company GATC GmbH	(Konstanz, Germany, www.gatc.de) or in ALTANA Pharma's lab using an ABI PRISM 310 and the Big dye terminator cycle sequencing v2 chemistry (Applied Biosystem). Sequence analysis was performed with Hitachi Software DNASIS Version 2.5 or with Vector NTI 7. When necessary, in vitro mutagenesis was eventually performed with the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene.	Cloning of human PDE 2A3	The PDE2A3 (GB no. U67733) was amplified in 2 steps using PCR from brain cDNA. A N-terminal fragment was isolated using primers CP1 PD2AS (5'- GAGGAGTGATGGGGCAGGC -3') and PR9PD2AA ( 5'- GCGAAGTGGGAGACAGAAAAG -3'), a C-terminal fragment was isolated using primers PR7PD2AS (5'- GATCCTGAACATCCCTGACG -3') and CP3PD2AA (5'-GGGATCACTCAGCATCAAGGC-3'). The PCR products were cloned into the vector pCR2.1-Topo. The N-terminal fragment was first subcloned with EcoRI into pBluescript Il KS (-), afterwards a Bst1107l/EcoRV fragment was exchanged with the corresponding restriction fragment from the C-terminal clone, to obtain a complete ORF. The ORF for the PDE2A3 was subcloned into pBP8 using Xbal and Kpnl.	Expression of recombinant PDE2	The rBV was prepared by means of homologous recombination in Sf9 insect cells. The expression plasmids were cotransfected with Bac-N-Blue (Invitrogen) or Baculo-Gold DNA (Pharmingen) using a standard protocol (Pharmingen). Wt virus-free recombinant virus supernatants were selected using plaque assay methods. After that, high-titre virus supernatants were prepared by amplifying 3 times. PDE2 was expressed in Sf21 cells by infecting 2x106 cells/ml with an MOI (multiplicity of infection) between 1 and 10 in serum-free SF900 medium (Life Technologies). Cells were cultured at 28°C , typically for 48 hours, after which they were pelleted for 5-10 min at 1000 g and 4°C. In spinner flasks, cells were cultured at a rotational speed of 75 rpm. The SF21 insect cells were resuspended, at a concentration of approx. 107 cells/ml, in ice-cold (4°C) homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.2, containing the following additions: 140 mM NaCI, 3.8 mM KCI, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCI2,	1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM benzamidine, 0.4 mM Pefablock, 10 μM leupeptin, 10 μM pepstatin A, 5 μM trypsin inhibitor) and disrupted by ultrasonication. The homogenate was then centrifuged for 10 min at 1000xg and the supernatant was stored at -800C until subsequent use (see below). The protein content was determined by the Bradford method (BioRad, Munich) using BSA as standard. Integrity and size of recombinant proteins were analysed by western blot.	Measurement of recombinant human PDE2A3 inhibition by SPA technology	Recombinant human PDE2A3 activities were inhibited by the test samples in a modified SPA	(scintillation proximity assay) test, supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (see procedural instructions "phosphodiesterase [3H]cAMP SPA enzyme assay, code TRKQ 7090"), carried out in 96-well microtitre plates (MTP's). The test volume is 100 μl and contains 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 mg of BSA (bovine serum albumin)/ml, 5 mM Mg2+, 0.5 μM cAMP (including about 50,000 cpm of [3H]CAMP), 5μM cGMP (to activate PDE2A3), 2 μl of the respective substance dilution in DMSO and sufficient recombinant PDE (1000xg supernatant, see above) to ensure that 15-20% of the cAMP is converted under the said experimental conditions. After a preincubation of 5 min at 37°C, the reaction is started by adding the substrate (cAMP) and the assays are incubated for a further 15 min; after that, they are stopped by adding SPA beads (50 μl). In accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, the SPA beads had previously been resuspended in water and then diluted 1 :3 (v/v); the diluted solution also contains 3 mM IBMX. After the beads have been sedimented (> 30 min), the MTP's are analyzed in commercially available measuring appliances and the corresponding IC50 values of the compounds for the inhibition of PDE activities are determined from the concentration-effect curves by means of non-linear regression.	Method to assess inhibition of macromolecule permeability of HUVEC monolayers	The procedure to measure macromolecule permeability of endothelial cell monolayers followed the method described by Langeler & van Hinsbergh (1988) with modifications. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were isolated from umbilical cords according to standard procedures (Jaffe et al. 1973) and cultured in endothelial cell basal medium (EBM) supplemented with 2% FCS, 0.5ng/ml VEGF, 10ng/ml bFGF, 5ng/ml EGF, 20ng/ml Long R3 IGF-1 , 0.2μg/ml hydrocortisone, 1 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 22.5μg/ml heparin, 50μg/ml gentamicin, 50ng/ml amphotericin B (EGM2 purchased from Promocell GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). At confluency, cells were trypsinized and replated at 73000 cells per well on 3μm polycarbonate filter Transwell inserts (Costar GmbH, Bodenheim, Germany) precoated with 10μg cm2 "1 Fibronectin (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). HUVECs were cultured in EGM2 (100μl in the upper wells and 600μl in the lower wells) over four days prior the experiments and medium was changed every other day. At the day of the experiment culture medium was replaced by M199 with 1 % human serum albumin. Endothelial cells were preincubated with cyclic nucleotide modifiers (the selective PDE3 inhibitor motapizone, the selective PDE4 inhibitor RP73401 , the cGMP generators ANP or SNP and PDE2 inhibitors) for 15 min. HUVECs were then stimulated with Thrombin (1 U ml"1) (Sigma, Taufkichen, Germany) and horsh radish peroxidase (5μg/ml) (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) as the macromolecule marker protein was added to the upper wells. Following 1 h incubation time Transwells were removed and the activity of horsh radish peroxidase that penetrated the endothelial cell monolayer was measured in the lower wells with the 3,3\ 5,5*-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany).	Results	Representative inhibitory values [measured as -log IC50 (mol/l)] determined in the aforementioned assay follow from the following table A, in which the numbers of the compounds correspond to the numbers of the examples.	Table A	Inhibition of PDE2 activity	In parallel, compounds according to the invention can inhibit Thrombin-induced permeability of HUVEC monolayers for horsh radish peroxidase (HRP) as a macromolecule marker. Therefore, PDE2 inhibitors are suggested to improve the endothelial barrier function, which is impaired in numerous conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or severe pneumonia. The system to measure these cellular effects of the PDE2 inhibitors observed the enzymological characteristics of PDE2 which exhibits a rather high Km for cAMP and the activity of which is activated by cGMP. The Thrombin-induced increase of HRP permeability was completely abolished by complete inhibition of PDE3 (10μM Motapizone) and PDE4 (1 μM RP73401). However, in the additional presence of ANP (10OnM) or SNP (1mM) to augment cGMP the inhibition by PDE3 and 4 inhibition of permeability was partially reversed. PDE2 inhibitors blocked the thrombin-stimulated HRP-permeability if 1 μM	RP73401 , 10μM Motapizone, 10OnM ANP or 1mM SNP were present indicating that ANP or SNP by generating cGMP activate PDE2. The concentration-dependent inhibition of HRP permeability at different concentrations was assessed from the percent inhibition in the presence and absence of the PDE2 inhibitors and in the presence of 1 μM RP73401 , 10μM Motapizone and 10OnM ANP. In the absence of PDE3 and 4 inhibition, ANP or SNP the PDE2 inhibitors showed very little effect in Thrombin-induced macromolecule hyperpermeability.	Inhibition of SNP- or ANP-induced permeability of HUVEC monolayers:	HUVEC cells on 3μm polycarbonate filters (Transwells) were preincubated with 1 μM RP73401 (to block PDE4) and 10μM Motapizone (to block PDE3), 1mM SNP or 10OnM ANP and 1 μM of test sample over 15 min and then stimulated with 1 U/ml thrombin. HRP passage into the lower wells was assessed after 60 min. RP73401 and Motapizone completely blocked thrombin-induced	hyperpermeability, which was partially reversed by SNP and ANP.	Compounds according to this invention can inhibit the SNP- or ANP-induced permeability increase in a concentration-dependent fashion.	Representative inhibitory values [measured as -log IC50 (mol/l)] determined in the aforementioned assay follow from the following table B, in which the numbers of the compounds correspond to the numbers of the examples.

Publication Language: English (EN)	Filing Language: English (EN)	TITLE OF THE INVENTION	ANTIDIABETIC BICYCLIC COMPOUNDS	FIELD OF THE INVENTION	The instant invention is concerned with bicyclic compounds containing a fused pyridine ring, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof, which are agonists of G-protein coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) and are useful as therapeutic compounds, particularly in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and of conditions that are often associated with this disease, including obesity and lipid disorders.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	Diabetes is a disease derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose (hyperglycemia) in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), insulin is still produced in the body. Patients having type 2 diabetes have a resistance to the effects of insulin in stimulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, which are muscle, liver and adipose tissues. These patients often have normal levels of insulin, and may have hyperinsulinemia (elevated plasma insulin levels), as they compensate for the reduced effectiveness of insulin by secreting increased amounts of insulin. Insulin resistance is not primarily caused by a diminished number of insulin receptors but rather by a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet completely understood. This lack of responsiveness to insulin results in insufficient insulin-mediated activation of uptake, oxidation and storage of glucose in muscle, and inadequate insulin-mediated repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver.	Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia that occurs with diabetes is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with obesity, hypertension, and alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism, as well as other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have a significantly increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, obesity, and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.	Patients who have insulin resistance often have several symptoms that together are referred to as syndrome X, or the metabolic syndrome. According to one widely used definition, a patient having metabolic syndrome is characterized as having three or more symptoms selected from the following group of five symptoms: (1) abdominal obesity; (2) hypertriglyceridemia; (3) low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL); (4) high blood pressure; and (5) elevated fasting glucose, which may be in the range characteristic of Type 2 diabetes if the patient is also diabetic. Each of these symptoms is defined clinically in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel HI, or ATP m), National Institutes of Health, 2001, NIH Publication No. 01-3670. Patients with metabolic syndrome, whether or not they have or develop overt diabetes mellitus, have an increased risk of developing the macrovascular and microvascular complications that occur with type 2 diabetes, such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.	There are several available treatments for type 2 diabetes, each of which has its own limitations and potential risks. Physical exercise and a reduction in dietary intake of calories often dramatically improve the diabetic condition and are the usual recommended first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes and of pre-diabetic conditions associated with insulin resistance. Compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of fat and carbohydrates. Pharmacologic treatments have focused on three areas of pathophysiology: (1) Hepatic glucose production (biguanides), (2) insulin resistance (PPAR agonists), and (3) insulin secretion.	The biguanides are a class of drugs that are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes. The two best known biguanides, phenformin and metformin, cause some correction of hyperglycemia. The biguanides act primarily by inhibiting hepatic glucose production, and they also are believed to modestly improve insulin sensitivity. The biguanides can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs, such as insulin or an insulin secretagogues, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. However, phenformin and metformin can induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea. Metformin has a lower risk of side effects than phenformin and is widely prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.	The glitazones (i.e. 5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones) are a newer class of compounds that can ameliorate hyperglycemia and other symptoms of type 2 diabetes. The glitazones that are currently marketed (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma subtype. The PPAR-gamma agonists substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of type 2 diabetes, resulting in partial or complete correction of elevated plasma glucose levels without the occurrence of hypoglycemia. PPAR-gamma agonism is believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensititization that is observed in human patients who are treated with the glitazones. New PPAR agonists are currently being developed. Many of the newer PPAR compounds are agonists of one or more of the PPAR alpha, gamma and delta subtypes. Compounds that are agonists of both the PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma subtypes (PPAR alpha/gamma dual agonists) are promising because they reduce hyperglycemia and also improve lipid metabolism. The currently marketed PPAR gamma agonists are modestly effective in reducing plasma glucose and HemoglobinAlC. The currently marketed compounds do not greatly improve lipid metabolism and may actually have a negative effect on the lipid profile. Thus, the PPAR compounds represent an important advance in diabetic therapy, but further improvements are still needed.	Another widely used drug treatment involves the administration of insulin secretagogues, such as the sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide and glipizide). These drugs increase the plasma level of insulin by stimulating the pancreatic ß-cells to secrete more insulin. Insulin secretion in the pancreatic ß-cell is under strict regulation by glucose and an array of metabolic, neural and hormonal signals.	Glucose stimulates insulin production and secretion through its metabolism to generate ATP and other signaling molecules, whereas other extracellular signals act as potentiators or inhibitors of insulin secretion through GPCR's present on the plasma membrane. Sulfonylureas and related insulin secretagogues act by blocking the ATP-dependent K+ channel in /3-cells, which causes depolarization of the cell and the opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels with stimulation of insulin release. This mechanism is non-glucose dependent, and hence insulin secretion can occur regardless of the ambient glucose levels. This can cause insulin secretion even if the glucose level is low, resulting in hypoglycemia, which can be fatal in severe cases. The administration of insulin secretagogues must therefore be carefully controlled. The insulin secretagogues are often used as a first-line drug treatment for Type 2 diabetes.	There has been a renewed focus on pancreatic islet-based insulin secretion that is controlled by glucose-dependent insulin secretion. This approach has the potential for stabilization and restoration of j3-cell function. In this regard, several orphan G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR's) have recently been identified that are preferentially expressed in the /3-cell and that are implicated in glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). GPR40 is a cell-surface GPCR that is highly expressed in human (and rodent) islets as well as in insulin-secreting cell lines. Several naturally-occurring medium to long-chain fatty acids (FA's) as well as synthetic compounds, including several members of the	thiazolidinedione class of PPAR? agonists, have recently been identified as ligands for GPR40 (Itoh, Y. et al., Nature. 422: 173 [2003]; Briscoe, CP. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 278: 11303 [2003]; Kotarsky, K. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 301: 406 [2003]. Under hyperglycemic conditions, GPR40 agonists are capable of augmenting the release of insulin from islet cells. The specificity of this response is suggested by results showing that the inhibition of GPR40 activity by siRNA attenuates FA-induced amplification of GSIS. These findings indicate that, in addition to the intracellular generation of lipid-derivatives of FA's that are thought to promote insulin release, FA's (and other synthetic GPR40 agonists) may also act as extracellular ligands that bind to GPR40 in mediating FA-induced insulin secretion. There are several potential advantages of GPR40 as a potential target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. First, since GPR40-mediated insulin secretion is glucose dependent, there is little or no risk of hypoglycemia.	Second, the limited tissue distribution of GPR40 (mainly in islets) suggests that there would be less chance for side effects associated with GPR40 activity in other tissues. Third, GPR40 agonists that are active in the islets may have the potential to restore or preserve islet function. This would be highly advantageous, because long term diabetes therapy often leads to the gradual diminution of islet activity, so that after extended periods of treatment, it is often necessary to treat type 2 diabetic patients with daily insulin injections. By restoring or preserving islet function, GPR40 agonists may delay or prevent the diminution and loss of islet function in a type 2 diabetic patient.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION	The class of compounds described herein is a new class of GPR40 agonists. The compounds are useful in the treatment of diseases that are modulated by GPR40 agonists, including type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia that may be associated with type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetic insulin resistance, gestational diabetes, and obesity.

Optical Isomers - Diastereomers - Geometric Isomers - Tautomers	Compounds of Formula I may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I. Specifically, the compounds of the instant invention have at least one asymmetric center, which is on the ring that is fused to the pyridine ring at the point where the Z group is attached to the ring. There is also a second asymmetric center in the compounds that have a heterocyclic acid function, such as a thiazolidinedione or oxazolidinedione, at the point of attachment of the heterocyclic ring. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers, and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers, stereoisomers, and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the scope of this invention (i.e. all possible combinations of the asymmetric centers as pure compounds or in mixtures).	Some of the compounds described herein may contain olefmic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.	Some of the compounds described herein may exist with different points of attachment of hydrogen, referred to as tautomers. An example is a ketone and its enol form, known as keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of Formula I.	Compounds of the Formula I having one or more asymmetric centers may be separated into diastereoisomers, enantiomers, and the like by methods well known in the art.	Alternatively, enantiomers and other compounds with chiral centers may be synthesized by stereospecif?c synthesis using optically pure starting materials and/or reagents of known	configuration.	Salts	The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from	pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts in the solid form may exist in more than one crystal structure, and may also be in the form of hydrates. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethyl-morpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like.

Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like. Particularly preferred are citric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, maleic, phosphoric, sulfuric, and tartaric acids.	It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of Formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts.	Metabolites - Prodrugs	Therapeutically active metabolites, where the metabolites themselves fall within the scope of the claimed invention, are also compounds of the current invention. Prodrugs, which are compounds that are converted to the claimed compounds as they are being administered to a patient or after they have been administered to a patient, are also compounds of this invention.

The compounds of the invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be efficacious in the treatment of diseases that are modulated by GPR40 ligands and agonists. Many of these diseases are summarized below.	One or more of the following diseases may be treated by the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a patient in need of treatment.

The compounds may be used for manufacturing a medicament for the treatment of one or more of these diseases:	(1) Type 2 diabetes, and specifically hyperglycemia;	(2) Metabolic syndrome;	(3) Obesity; and	(4) Hypercholesterolemia.	The compounds are expected to be effective in lowering glucose, lipids, and insulin in diabetic patients and in non-diabetic patients who have impaired glucose tolerance and/or are in a pre-diabetic condition. The compounds may ameliorate hyperinsulinemia, which often occurs in diabetic or pre-diabetic patients, by modulating the swings in the level of serum glucose that often occurs in these patients. The compounds may also be effective in treating or reducing insulin resistance. The compounds may be effective in treating or preventing gestational diabetes.	The compounds, compositions, and medicaments as described herein may also be effective in reducing the risks of adverse sequelae associated with metabolic syndrome, and in reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, delaying the onset of atherosclerosis, and/or reducing the risk of sequelae of atherosclerosis. Sequelae of atherosclerosis include angina, claudication, heart attack, stroke, and others.	By keeping hyperglycemia under control, the compounds may also be effective in delaying or preventing vascular restenosis and diabetic retinopathy.	The compounds of this invention may have activity in improving or restoring /3-cell function, so that they may be useful in treating type 1 diabetes or in delaying or preventing a patient with type 2 diabetes from needing insulin therapy.	The compounds generally may be efficacious in treating one or more of the following diseases: (1) type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, or NIDDM), (2) hyperglycemia, (3) low glucose tolerance, (4) insulin resistance, (5) obesity, (6) lipid disorders, (7) dyslipidemia, (8) hyperlipidemia, (9) hypertriglyceridemia, (10) hypercholesterolemia, (11) low HDL levels, (12) high LDL levels, (13) atherosclerosis and its sequelae, (14) vascular restenosis, (15) abdominal obesity, (16) retinopathy, (17) metabolic syndrome, (18) high blood pressure, and (19) insulin resistance.	One aspect of the invention provides a method for the treatment and control of mixed or diabetic dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, low HDL levels, high LDL levels, hyperlipidemia, and/or hypertriglyceridemia, which comprises administering to a patient in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound having formula I. The compound may be used alone or advantageously may be administered with a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, particularly an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor such as lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rivastatin, itavastatin, or ZD-4522. The compound may also be used advantageously in combination with other lipid lowering drugs such as cholesterol absorption inhibitors (for example stanol esters, sterol glycosides such as tiqueside, and azetidinones such as ezetimibe), ACAT inhibitors (such as avasimibe), CETP inhibitors (for example torcetrapib), niacin, bile acid sequestrants, microsomal triglyceride transport inhibitors, and bile acid reuptake inhibitors. These combination treatments may be effective for the treatment or control of one or more related conditions selected from the group consisting of hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia, high LDL, and low HDL.	Administration and Dose Ranges	Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dose of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, -ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Preferably compounds of Formula I are administered orally.	The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated and the severity of the condition being treated. Such dosage may be ascertained readily by a person skilled in the art.	When treating or controlling diabetes mellitus and/or hyperglycemia or	hypertriglyceridemia or other diseases for which compounds of Formula I are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 1 milligram to about 350 milligrams. For a particularly potent compound, the dosage for an adult human may be as low as 0.1 mg. The dosage regimen may be adjusted within this range or even outside of this range to provide the optimal therapeutic response.	Oral administration will usually be carried out using tablets or capsules. Examples of doses in tablets and capsules are 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 350 mg. Other oral forms may also have the same or similar dosages.	Pharmaceutical Compositions	Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, if a prodrug is administered.	The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.	In practical use, the compounds of Formula I can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.	Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compounds can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray.	The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.	Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.	Compounds of formula I may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.	The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.	Combination Therapy	Compounds of Formula I may be used in combination with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which compounds of Formula I are useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of Formula I. In the treatment of patients who have type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and co-morbidities that accompany these diseases, more than one drug is commonly administered. The compounds of this invention may generally be administered to a patient who is already taking one or more other drugs for these conditions.	When a compound of Formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I is preferred. However, the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the compound of Formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compound of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of Formula I.	Examples of other active ingredients that may be administered in combination with a compound of Formula I, and either administered separately or in the same pharmaceutical composition, include, but are not limited to:	(a) PPAR gamma agonists and partial agonists, including both glitazones and non-glitazones (e.g. troglitazone, pioglitazone, englitazone, MCC-555, rosiglitazone, balaglitazone, netoglitazone, T-131, LY-300512, and LY-818;	(b) biguanides such as metformin and phenformin;	(c) protein tyrosine phosphatase-lB (PTP-IB) inhibitors;	(d) dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP-IV) inhibitors, such as MK-0431 and LAF-237;	(e) insulin or insulin mimetics;	(f) sulfonylureas such as tolbutamide and glipizide, or related materials;	(g) a-glucosidase inhibitors (such as acarbose);	(h) agents which improve a patient's lipid profile, such as (i) HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rivastatin, itavastatin, ZD-4522 and other statins), (ii) bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colestipol, and dialkylaminoalkyl derivatives of a cross-linked dextran), (iii) nicotinyl alcohol, nicotinic acid or a salt thereof, (iv) PP ARa agonists such as fenof?bric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil, clofibrate, fenofibrate and bezafibrate), (v) cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such as for example ezetimibe, (vi) acyl	CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, such as avasimibe, (vii) CETP inhibitors, such as torcetrapib, and (viii) phenolic anti-oxidants, such as probucol;	(i) PPARa/? dual agonists, such as muraglitazar, tesaglitazar, farglitazar, and JT-501;	(j) PPARd agonists such as those disclosed in WO97/28149;	(k) antiobesity compounds such as fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, phentiramine, subitramine, orlistat, neuropeptide Y5 inhibitors, Mc4r agonists, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB-I) antagonists/inverse agonists, and ß3 adrenergic receptor agonists;	
WO2006083612_0005	(1) ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors;	(m) agents intended for use in inflammatory conditions such as aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, azulfidine, and cyclo-oxygenase 2 selective inhibitors;	(n) glucagon receptor antagonists;	(o) GLP-I,	(p) GIP-I,	(q) GLP-I analogs, such as exendins, for example exenitide, and	(r) Hydroxysterol dehydrogenase- 1 (HSD-I) inhibitors .	The above combinations include combinations of a compound of the present invention not only with one other active compound, but also with two or more other active compounds. Non-limiting examples include combinations of compounds having Formula I with two or more active compounds selected from biguanides, sulfonylureas, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, other PPAR agonists, PTP-IB inhibitors, DP-IV inhibitors, and anti-obesity compounds.	BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS	Generation of GPR40-Expressing Cells	Human and mouse GPR40 stable cell-lines were generated in CHO cells stably expressing NFAT BLA (Beta-lactamase). A human GPR40 stable cell-line was generated in HEK cells stably expressing the aequorin expressing reporter. The expression plasmids were transfected using lipofectamine (Life Technologies) following manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell-lines were generated following drug selection.	FLIPR Assays	FLIPR (Fluorimetric Imaging Plate Reader, Molecular Devices) assays were performed to measure agonist-induced calcium mobilization of the stable clones. For the FLIPR assay, one day before assay, GPR40/CHO NFAT BLA cells were seeded into black-wall-clear-bottom 384-well plates (Costar) at 1.4 x 10e4 cells / 20 µl medium / well. The cells were incubated with 20 µl / well of the assay buffer (HBSS, 0.1 % BSA, 20 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 8µM fluo-4,AM, 0.08 % pluronic acid at room temperature for 100 minutes. Fluorescence output was measured using FLIPR. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted to desired concentrations with assay buffer. 13.3 µl/well of compound solution was added.	Inositol Phosphate Turnover Assay	The assay is performed in 96-well format. HEK cells stably expressing human GPR40 are plated to be 60-80% confluent within 72 hours. After 72 hours, the plates are aspirated and the cells washed with inositol-free DMEM (ICN). The wash media is replaced with 15OuL of 3H-inositol labeling media (inositol-free media containing 0.4% human albumin or 0.4% mouse albumin, IX pen/strep antibiotics, glutamine, 25mM HEPES to which is added 3H-myo-inositol NEN #NET114A lmCi/mL, 25Ci/mmol diluted 1:150 in loading media with a final specific radioactivity of luCi/150uL).	Alternatively, the human and mouse albumin can be added after the overnight labeling step before the addition of LiCl.	The assay is typically run the next day after 18 hours labeling. On the day of the assay, 5uL of 30OmM LiCl is added to all wells and incubated at 37 degrees for 20 mins. 0.75uL of 200X compounds are added and incubated with the cells for 60 minutes at 37 degrees. The media is then aspirated off and the assay terminated with the addition of 6OuL 1OmM formic acid. The cells are lysed for 60 mins at room temperature. 15-3OuL of lysate is mixed with 70uL/lmg YSi SPA beads (Amersham) in clear bottom Isoplates. The plates are shaken for 2 hours at room temperature. Beads are allowed to settle and the plates are counted in the Wallac Microbeta.	In Vivo Studies	Male C57BL/6N mice (7-12 weeks of age) are housed 10 per cage and given access to normal diet rodent chow and water ad libitum. Mice are randomly assigned to treatment groups and fasted 4 to 6 hours. Baseline blood glucose concentrations are determined by glucometer from tail nick blood. Animals are then treated orally with vehicle (0.25% methylcellulose) or test compound. Blood glucose concentration is measured at a set time point after treatment (t = 0 min) and mice are then intraperitoneally-challenged with dextrose (2 g/kg). One group of vehicle-treated mice is challenged with saline as a negative control. Blood glucose levels are determined from tail bleeds taken at 20, 40, 60 minutes after dextrose challenge. The blood glucose excursion profile from t = 0 to t = 60 min is used to integrate an area under the curve (AUC) for each treatment. Percent inhibition values for each treatment are generated from the AUC data normalized to the saline-challenged controls.

Field of the Invention	The present invention relates to indazole derivatives, which can be used as vanilloid receptor ligands, processes for their preparation, and their use in treating diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by vanilloid receptors.	Background of the Invention	Pain is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical advice and treatment. Pain can be either acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limiting, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality, lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (K. M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine 100-107, J. C. Bennett and F. Plum eds., 20th ed., 1996). The sensation of pain can be triggered by any number of physical or chemical stimuli, and the sensory neurons which mediate the response to these harmful stimuli are known as "nociceptors". Nociceptors are primary sensory afferent (C and Ad fibers) neurons that are activated by a wide variety of noxious stimuli including chemical, mechanical, thermal, and proton (pH <6) modalities.	Moreover, chronic pain can be further classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic.	Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the sensory nerves of the peripheral or central nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. There is a large body of evidence relating activity at vanilloid receptors (such as vanilloid receptor 1 or VRl) (V. Di Marzo et ai, Current Opinion in Neurobiology 12: 372-379, 2002) to pain processing.	The lipophillic vanilloid, Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamides; CAP) is known to stimulate pain pathways through the release of a variety of sensory afferent neurotransmitters via a specific cell surface capsaicin receptor, cloned as the first vanilloid receptor (VRl, now known as transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 or TRPVl) (Caterina MJ. et.al.. Science , Apr 14; 288 (5464): 306-13, 2000). Capsaicin is the main pungent component in hot pepper. Hot pepper has been used historically not only as a spice, but also as a traditional medicine in the treatment of gastric disorders orally, and applied locally for the relief of pain and inflammation. CAP has a wide spectrum of biological actions and not only exhibits effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, but also induces pain and irritancy on local application. CAP, however, after such induction of pain induces desensitization, both to CAP itself and also to other noxious stimuli, thereby stopping the pain. The intradermal administration of capsaicin is characterized by an initial burning or hot sensation followed by a prolonged period of analgesia. The analgesic component of VRl receptor activation is thought to be mediated by a capsaicin-induced desensitization of the primary sensory afferent terminal. Based on this property, CAP and its analogues such as olvanil, nuvanil, DA-5018, SDZ-249482, and resiniferatoxin are either used or are under development as analgesic agents or therapeutic agents for urinary incontinence or skin disorders (Wriggleworth and Walpore, Drugs of the Future, 23: pp 531-538, 1998).	VRl is widely expressed in non-neuronal tissues in various organ systems, and the functional roles of VRl in various systems are not properly understood at this time. An increasing number of animal studies have revealed the possible involvement of VRl receptors in a number of pathologies. Based on this information VRl is now being considered as a molecular target for various indications such as migraine, arthralgia, diabetic neuropathy, neurodegeneration, neurotic skin disorder, stroke, cardiac pain arising from an ischemic myocardium, Huntington's disease, memory deficits, restricted brain function, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia, urinary bladder hypersensitiveness, urinary incontinence, vulvodynia, pruritic conditions such as uremic pruritus, irritable bowel syndrome including gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), enteritis, ileitis, stomach-duodenal ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn's disease, celiac disease and inflammatory diseases such as pancreatitis, and in respiratory disorders such as allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, irritation of skin, eye or mucous membrane, dermatitis, and in non specific disorders such as fervescence, retinopathy, muscle spasms, emesis, dyskinesias and depression. Specifically, VRl antagonists are likely to be useful in multiple sub-types of pain such as acute, chronic, neuropathic pain or post-operative pain, as well as in pain due to neuralgia (e.g., post herpetic neuralgia and trigeminal neuralgia), and in pain due to diabetic neuropathy, dental pain, and cancer pain. Additionally, VRl antagonists will also prove useful in the treatment of inflammatory pain conditions such as arthritis or osteoarthritis. VRl antagonists hold potential benefit in diabetes, obesity, urticaria, actinic keratosis, keratocanthoma, alopecia, Meniere's disease, tinnitus, hyperacusis and anxiety disorders.	One class of natural and synthetic compounds that modulate the function of vanilloid receptor 1 (VRl) has been characterized by the presence of a vanillyl (4-hydroxy 3-methoxybenzyl) group or a functionally equivalent group and has been widely studied and is extensively reviewed by Szallasi and Blumberg (The Am. Soc. for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Vol. 51, No. 2, 1999).	Various vanilloid agonists and antagonists have been developed for the treatment of pain. The agonists work through desensitizing the receptor while antagonists block its stimulation by (patho) physiological ligands. The first antagonist Capsazepine was developed by Novartis.	There are other VRl antagonists, which are at the preclinical stage, for example, Amore Pacific's PAC-20030, Neurogen's BCTC, Abbott's A-425619 and Amgen's AMG-9810.	European Patent Publication No. EP 462761 discloses (benzopyranyl) phenylureas and related compounds as potassium channel activators and a method of using these and other compounds having potassium channel activating activity as antiischemic and/or anti- arrhythmic agents.	PCT Publication No. WO 2003/080578 discloses heteroaromatic ureas as vanilloid receptor (VRl) modulators, in particular antagonists, for treating pain and/or inflammation. PCT Publication No. WO 05/007652 describes substituted quinolin-4-yl-amine analogues useful in the treatment of conditions related to capsaicin receptor activation.	PCT Publication No. WO 2007/042906 discloses substituted benzofused derivatives as VRl antagonists. PCT Publication No. WO 2007/121299 discloses spirochromane compounds as VRl antagonists.	There is a need for better analgesics for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain, and the treatment of various neuropathic pain states.

The following definitions apply to the terms as used herein:	The term "alkyl" refers to a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain radical consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms, containing no unsaturation, having from one to eight carbon atoms, and which is attached to the rest of the molecule by a single bond, e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, 1 -methylethyl (isopropyl), n-butyl, n-pentyl, and 1,1-dimethylethyl (t-butyl).	The term "alkenyl" refers to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing a carbon-carbon double bond and which may be a straight or branched chain having from 2 to about 10 carbon atoms, e.g., ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl (allyl), iso-propenyl, 2-methyl-l-propenyl, 1-butenyl, and 2-butenyl.	The term "alkynyl" refers to a straight or branched chain hydrocarbyl radical having at least one carbon-carbon triple bond, and having from 2 to about 12 carbon atoms (with radicals having from 2 to about 10 carbon atoms being preferred), e.g., ethynyl, propynyl, and butynyl.	The term "alkoxy" denotes an alkyl group attached via an oxygen linkage to the rest of the molecule. Representative examples of such groups are -OCH3 and -OC2H5.	The term "alkoxycarbonyl" denotes an alkyl group attached via an carbonyl linkage to the rest of the molecule. Representative examples of such groups are -COOCH3 and -COOC2H5	The term "cycloalkyl" denotes a non-aromatic mono or multicyclic ring system of from 3 to about 12 carbon atoms, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl.

M.P. - 244 - 2450C Example 3: Screening for TRPVl antagonist using the 45Calcium uptake assay:	The inhibition of TRPVl -receptor activation was followed as inhibition of capsaicin induced cellular uptake of radioactive calcium, which represents calcium influx exclusively through the plasma membrane-associated TRPVl receptor.	Materials:	Stock solutions of capsaicin were made in ethanol, and test compounds in 100 % DMSO. Stock solutions were diluted to appropriate final concentrations in assay buffer keeping the final DMSO concentration between 0.1% and 0.55%.	45Ca was used at a final concentration of 2.5 µCi/ml (45Ca, MP Biomedicals, formerly ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CAICN, ).	Assay buffer was composed of F- 12 DMEM medium supplemented with 1.8 mM CaCl2	(final cone.) and 0.1% Bovine serum albumin.(BSA from S IGM A- ALDRICH, St. Louis,	MO).	Wash buffer was Tyrodes solution supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 1.8 mM calcium. Lysis buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 % Triton X- 100, 0.5%	deoxycholate and 0.1% Sodium dodicyl sulphate (SDS,SIGMA-ALDRICH, St. Louis, MO). Method:	The assay was carried out with some modifications of the procedure described by Toth et.al.( See Toth A et. al, Life Sciences 73 p 487-498 ,2003). Human TRPVl expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium -GIBCO) medium with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum Hyclone), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, 400 µg / ml of G-418. Cells were seeded 48 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get ~ 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Plates were incubated at 370C in the presence of 5 % CO2. Cells were then washed twice with 200 µl of assay buffer and re-suspended in 144 µl of the same. Assays were carried out at 3O0C in a total volume of 200 µl. Test compounds were added to the cells fifteen minutes before the addition of capsaicin. The final concentration of capsaicin used in the assay was 250 nM. After 5 minutes of agonist treatment, the drug was washed out and the wells were rinsed 3X with 300 µl of ice cold wash buffer. The cells were lysed in 50 µl of lysis buffer for 20 min. 40 µl of cell lysate was mixed with 150 µl of Microscint PS, and the mixture was left overnight for equilibration. Radioactivity in samples was measured as counts per minute (cpm) using a Packard Biosciences Top Count. The drug / vehicle / capsaicin treated 45Ca uptake values were normalized over basal 45Ca value. Data was expressed as % inhibition of 45Ca uptake by test compound with respect to maximum 45Ca uptake induced by capsaicin alone. An IC50 value was calculated from the dose response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).	
WO2008110863_0010	Results were expressed as IC50 ranged from between about 0.9nM to about 60 nM; from between about 0.9 nM to about 30 nM, from between about 0.9 nM to about 20 nM; from between about 0.9 nM to about 10 nM; from between about 0.9 nM to about 2.5nM.

The invention further relates to compounds that are useful in the inhibition of the activity of 15-lipoxygenase and thus in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and of inflammation generally. The invention also relates to the use of such compounds as medicaments, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to synthetic routes for their production.	Background of the Invention	There are many diseases/disorders that are inflammatory in their nature. One of the major problems associated with existing treatments of inflammatory conditions is a lack of efficacy and/or the prevalence of side effects (real or perceived).	Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 6% to 8% of the adult population of the industrialized world. In children, the incidence is even higher, being close to 10% in most countries. Asthma is the most common cause of hospitalization for children under the age of fifteen.	Treatment regimens for asthma are based on the severity of the condition. Mild cases are either untreated or are only treated with inhaled ß-agonists. Patients with more severe asthma are typically treated with anti-inflammatory compounds on a regular basis.	There is a considerable under-treatment of asthma, which is due at least in part to perceived risks with existing maintenance therapy (mainly inhaled corticosteroids). These include risks of growth retardation in children and loss of bone mineral density, resulting in unnecessary morbidity and mortality. As an alternative to steroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRas) have been developed. These drugs may be given orally, but are considerably less efficacious than inhaled steroids and usually do not control airway inflammation satisfactorily.	This combination of factors has led to at least 50% of all asthma patients being inadequately treated.	A similar pattern of under-treatment exists in relation to allergic disorders, where drugs are available to treat a number of common conditions but are underused in view of apparent side effects. Rhinitis, conjunctivitis and dermatitis may have an allergic component, but may also arise in the absence of underlying allergy. Indeed, non-allergic conditions of this class are in many cases more difficult to treat.	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease affecting 6% to 8% of the world population. The disease is potentially lethal, and the morbidity and mortality from the condition is considerable. At present, there is no known pharmacological treatment capable of changing the course of COPD.	Other inflammatory disorders which may be mentioned include:	(a) pulmonary fibrosis (this is less common than COPD, but is a serious disorder with a very bad prognosis. No curative treatment exists);	(b) inflammatory bowel disease (a group of disorders with a high morbidity rate. Today only symptomatic treatment of such disorders is available); and	(c) rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (common disabling inflammatory disorders of the joints. There are currently no curative, and only moderately effective symptomatic, treatments available for the management of such conditions).	Inflammation is also a common cause of pain. Inflammatory pain may arise for numerous reasons, such as infection, surgery or other trauma. Moreover, several malignancies are known to have inflammatory components adding to the symptomatology of the patients.	Thus, a new and/or alternative anti-inflammatory treatment would be of benefit to all of the above-mentioned patient groups. In particular, there is a real and substantial unmet clinical need for an effective anti-inflammatory drug capable of treating inflammatory disorders, such as asthma, with no real or perceived side effects.	The mammalian lipoxygenases are a family of structurally-related enzymes, which catalyze the oxygenation of inter alia arachidonic acid. Three types of human lipoxygenases are known, which catalyze the insertion of molecular oxygen into arachidonic acid at carbon positions 5, 12 and 15. The enzymes are thus named 5-, 12- and 15-lipoxygenase, respectively.	Arachidonic acid metabolites that are formed following the action of lipoxygenases are known to have pronounced pathophysiological activity including pro-inflammatory effects.	For example, the primary product of the action of 5-lipoxygenase on arachidonic acid is further converted by a number of enzymes to a variety of physiologically and pathophysiological^ important metabolites. The most important of these, the leukotrienes, are strong bronchoconstrictors. Huge efforts have been devoted towards the development of drugs that inhibit the action of these metabolites as well as the biological processes that form them. Drugs that have been developed to this end include 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, inhibitors of FLAP (Five Lipoxygenase Activating Protein) and, as mentioned previously, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRas).	Another class of enzymes that metabolize arachidonic acid are the cyclooxygenases. Arachidonic acid metabolites that are produced by this process include prostaglandins, thromboxanes and prostacyclin, all of which possess physiological or pathophysiological activity. In particular, the prostaglandin PGE2 is a strong pro-inflammatory mediator, which also induces fever and pain. Consequently, a number of drugs have been developed to inhibit the formation of PGE2, including "NSAIDs" (non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs) and "coxibs" (selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors). These classes of compounds act predominantly by way of inhibition of one or several cyclooxygenases.	Thus, in general, agents that are capable of blocking the formation of arachidonic acid metabolites are likely to be of benefit in the treatment of inflammation.	The listing or discussion of an apparently prior-published document in this specification should not necessarily be taken as an acknowledgement that the document is part of the state of the art or is common general knowledge.	
WO2008129280_0002	A 2-pyrazolobenzoxazole has been disclosed as a potential antimicrobial drug in Vinsova et al, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry (2006), 14(17), 5850-5865. However, there is no mention in that document of the use of any of the compounds disclosed therein as inhibitors of lipoxygenases, and therefore in the treatment of inflammation.	Certain pyrazolecarboxylic acid hydrazides, structurally unrelated to the compounds described herein, have been disclosed as anti-inflammatory agents in Tihanyi et al, Eur. J. Med. Chem. - Chim. Ther., 1984, 19, 433 and Goel et al, J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1995, 35, 510.	Vertuani et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 74, No. 9 (1985) discloses various pyrazoles that possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. There is no mention or suggestion of pyrazoles that are substituted at the 3-position with an oxazole ring.	US 6,166,041 discloses various benzoxazole PDE IV inhibitors for the treatment of asthma. However, this document only discloses benzoxazoles that are substituted, either directly attached or via a linker group, at the benzene ring of the benzoxazole (at the 7-position) with a phenyl ring or monocyclic ring containing at least one heteroatom.	International patent application WO 2006/092430 and national patent application	DE 10 2005 009 705 disclose various bicyclic compounds, that are primarily naphthalenes, that may be useful in the inhibition of human corticosteroid synthase, and therefore in the treatment of diseases such as hypercortisolism and diabetes mellitus. However, there is no mention of the use of the compounds disclosed therein as lipoxygenase inhibitors that are therefore useful in the treatment of inflammation.	International patent application WO 2007/019417 discloses various compounds as sirtuin modulators. However, that document only discloses compounds comprising a series of three aromatic groups, and, further, there is no disclosure therein of the use of such compounds as inhibitors of lipoxygenases that are therefore useful in the treatment of inflammation.	International patent application WP 2006/04614 discloses compounds containing aromatic groups, which compounds may be useful as glucocorticoid receptor modulators. Such compounds include inter alia pyrazoles. However, this document does not disclose pyrazoles that are not substituted with a sulfonamide group.	International patent applications WO 2004/080999 and WO 2006/032852 both disclose various 3-amidopyrazoles for use in the treatment of inflammation. However, there is no disclosure or suggestion in either of these documents of N-unsubstituted pyrazoles for use in such treatment.	US patent application US 2005/0070589 discloses various pyrazoles as potential inhibitors of 15-lipoxygenase. However, there the pyrazoles disclosed therein are necessarily substituted at the 4-position with an alkyl group that is necessarily substituted with a substituent containing a nitrogen heteroatom. US patent application US 2004/0198768 discloses various bicyclic compounds, including benzazoles, that may be useful as 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors. However, such benzazoles are necessarily substituted at the 2-position with an aminophenyl group. European patent application EP 0 418 845 and international patent application WO 2004/080999 both disclose various pyrazoles for use as medicaments. However, both documents only mention pyrazoles that are 1 (N)-substituted.	International patent application WO 2006/032851 discloses various 3-amidopyrazoles for use in the treatment of inflammation. Further, international patent applications WO 2007/045868, WO 2007/051981 , WO 2007/052000 and WO 2007/051982 disclose either 3-amidopyrazoles or amidotriazoles for use in the treatment of inflammation. However, there is no disclosure or suggestion in any of these documents of pyrazoles that are substituted in the 3-position with an oxazole group.

Pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Such salts may be formed by conventional means, for example by reaction of a free acid or a free base form of a compound of formula I with one or more equivalents of an appropriate acid or base, optionally in a solvent, or in a medium in which the salt is insoluble, followed by removal of said solvent, or said medium, using standard techniques (e.g. in vacuo, by freeze-drying or by filtration). Salts may also be prepared by exchanging a counter-ion of a compound of the invention in the form of a salt with another counter-ion, for example using a suitable ion exchange resin.	Compounds of the invention may contain double bonds and may thus exist as E (entgegen) and Z {zusammen) geometric isomers about each individual double bond. All such isomers and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention.	Compounds of the invention may also exhibit tautomehsm. All tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention.	Compounds of the invention may also contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and may therefore exhibit optical and/or diastereoisomerism. Diastereoisomers may be separated using conventional techniques, e.g. chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The various stereoisomers may be isolated by separation of a racemic or other mixture of the compounds using conventional, e.g. fractional crystallisation or HPLC, techniques. Alternatively the desired optical isomers may be made by reaction of the appropriate optically active starting materials under conditions which will not cause racemisation or epimerisation (i.e. a 'chiral pool' method), by reaction of the appropriate starting material with a 'chiral auxiliary' which can subsequently be removed at a suitable stage, by derivatisation (i.e. a resolution, including a dynamic resolution), for example with a homochiral acid followed by separation of the diastereomeric derivatives by conventional means such as chromatography, or by reaction with an appropriate chiral reagent or chiral catalyst all under conditions known to the skilled person. All stereoisomers and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention.	Unless otherwise specified, C1-q alkyl (where q is the upper limit of the range), defined herein may be straight-chain or, when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of three) of carbon atoms, be branched-chain, and/or cyclic (so forming, in the case of alkyl, a C3-q cycloalkyl group). Further, when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of four) of carbon atoms, such groups may also be part cyclic. Further, unless otherwise specified, such alkyl groups may also be saturated or, when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of two) of carbon atoms and unless otherwise specified, be unsaturated (forming, for example, a	C2.q alkenyl or a C2-q alkynyl group).	The term "halo", when used herein, includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.	Aryl groups that may be mentioned include C6.14 (e.g. C6.io) aryl groups. Such groups may be monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic and have between 6 and 14 ring carbon atoms, in which at least one ring is aromatic. C6-M aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl and the like, such as 1 ,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl, indenyl and fluorenyl. Heteroaryl groups that may be mentioned include those which have between 5 and 14 (e.g. between 5 and 10) members. Such groups may be monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic, provided that at least one of the rings is aromatic and wherein at least one (e.g. one to four) of the atoms in the ring system is other than carbon (i.e. a heteroatom).	Heteroatoms that may be mentioned include phosphorus, silicon, boron, tellurium, selenium and, preferably, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur.	For the avoidance of doubt, when a phrase such as "R36 to R3h" is employed herein, this will be understood by the skilled person to mean R3b, R3c, R3d, R3e, R3f, R39 and R3h inclusively.	For the avoidance of doubt, where it is stated that A1, A2, A3 and A4 each respectively represent -C(R3)=, -C(R4)=, -C(R5)= and -C(R6)=, or, each of these represent -N=, we mean that: A1 may represent -C(R3)= or -N=: A2 may represent -C(R4)= or -N=; A3 may represent -C(R5)= or -N=; and A4 may represent -C(R6)= or -N=. That is, A1, A2, A3 and A4 respectively represent -C(R3)=, -C(R4)=, -C(R5)= and -C(R6)=, or, each of these may alternatively and independently represent -N=.	For the avoidance of doubt, in cases in which the identity of two or more substituents in a compound of formula I may be the same, the actual identities of the respective substituents are not in any way interdependent. For example, in the situation in which two or more of R3, R4. R5 and R6 are present and represent X1, in which the two (or more) X1 groups are R3a, in which R3a is a C1-6 alkyl group, the respective alkyl groups may be the same or different. Hence, where there is, for example, more than one X1 group present in the compound of formula I, then such groups are not in any way interdependent, i.e. they may be the same or different.	Compounds of the invention that may be mentioned include those in which:	R3b to R3h, R3k, R3n, R3q, R4s to R4h, R5a, R5b, R5d and R5f to R5h independently represent H or Ci-6 alkyl optionally substituted by one or more halo atoms or -OR6d; or	any of the pairs R4a and R5a, R4b and R5b, R4d and R5d, R4f and R5f, R4s and R59, and R4h and R5h, may be linked together to form a 3- to 6-membered ring, which ring optionally contains a further heteroatom (such as nitrogen or oxygen) in addition to the nitrogen atom to which these substituents are necessarily attached, and which ring is optionally substituted by =0 and/or Ci-6 alkyl optionally substituted by one or more fluoro atoms.

Alternative methods of performing this step include reaction of an O-protected derivative (e.g. an ethyl ester) of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula IV, which latter compound may first be treated with an appropriate reagent (e.g. trimethylaluminium), for example in an inert atmosphere and in the presence of a suitable solvent (e.g. dichloromethane); or	(c) reaction of a compound of formula XIX,	or a ?/-protected (e.g. at the pyrazole nitrogen) derivative thereof, wherein R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined, with a compound of formula XX,	XX	or a protected (e.g. at the requisite -OH group) derivative thereof (so forming, for example, a benzyl-protected compound of formula XX), wherein L1 represents a suitable leaving group, such as halo (e.g. chloro, bromo and iodo), -OSO2CF3, -B(OH)2, -Sn(Rz)3 (wherein Rz is as hereinbefore defined), -Pb(OC(O)CH3)3, -Bi(W)2,	-Bi(W)2(OC(O)CHs)2, -Bi(W)2(OC(O)CFs)2 or -1(W)(BF4), and W represents an aryl or heteroaryl group, both of which are optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from X1 as hereinbefore defined (e.g. W represents the A1 to A4 containing phenyl ring, substituted with -OH, of the compound of formula V as hereinbefore defined), and A1, A2, A3 and A4 are as hereinbefore defined, for example in the presence of a catalyst containing, preferably, Pd or Cu, and a base, such as potassium or sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium te/t-butoxide and lithium ?/,?/-diisopropylamide. Catalysts that may be mentioned include Pd2(dba)3 (tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(O)), bases that may be mentioned include cesium carbonate, ligands that may be mentioned include 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1 ,T- binaphthyl and solvents that may be employed include toluene.	Such reactions may be performed at elevated temperature (e.g. at about 900C) under an inert (e.g. argon) atmosphere. The skilled person will appreciate that a protected derivative (e.g. at the -OH group) of a compound of formula XX may be necessary during the above reaction.	Compounds of formula VIIA may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula XXA,	wherein A1, A2, A3, A4 and R1 are as hereinbefore defined, with a compound of formula XXB,	Rd-C(O)-L4 XXB	wherein L4 represents a suitable leaving group, such as halo (e.g. bromo or chloro), or C1-6 alkoxy (e.g. methoxy), and Rd is as hereinbefore defined, for example under standard condensation reaction conditions, for example in the presence of a suitable base, an appropriate solvent, and reaction conditions, such as those hereinbefore defined in respect of preparation of compounds of formula I (process step (i)). Preferred bases include metal hydrides (e.g. sodium hydride), or amide bases (e.g. lithium diisopropylamide).	Compounds of formula VIIB may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula XIII as hereinbefore described, for example under reaction conditions analogous to those hereinbefore described in respect of preparation of compounds of formula I (process step (i)), e.g. in the presence of a suitable base such as one described in that process step (e.g. a lithiation reaction) followed by reaction in the presence of an appropriate electrophilic compound. For instance, for the preparation of a compound of formula VIIB in which Lx represents halo, in the presence of an electrophile that provides a source of halogen (e.g. a reagent described in process step (i)(b) above), for the introduction of a sulfonate group, by reaction with a corresponding compound in which there is a hydroxy group present with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride, for the introduction of -Sn(Rwx)3, by reaction with the appropriate trialkyl tin chloride (or the like), etc. For the introduction of -B(OH)2 and -B(ORWX)2, a coupling reaction may be performed from the corresponding halo derivative and the appropriate boronic acid (or derivative thereof) under reaction conditions such as those described in respect of preparation of compounds of formula I (process step (ix)).	Compounds of formula VIIC may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula XXX, as defined hereinafter, for example under reaction conditions such as those described hereinbefore in respect of preparation of compounds of formula VIIB. Alternatively, compounds of formula VIIC in which Ly represents chloro or bromo may be prepared by reaction of a corresponding compound of formula XXC,	wherein A1 to A4 are as hereinbefore defined, with a suitable reagent that provides a source of bromo or chloro, for example PCI5, POCI3 and POBr3 (or the like).

Alternatively, compounds of formula IX may be prepared by ?/-dealkylation of a compound of formula XXI,	wherein T represents optionally substituted C1-6 alkyl (e.g. methyl) and Ra and Rb are as hereinbefore defined, under dealkylation conditions known to those skilled in the art, for example by reaction with a suitable reagent (e.g. pyridine hydrochloride) at high temperatures (e.g. 15O0C to 2200C)). Such a reaction may be carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent, but preferably no further solvent is present.	Alternatively still, compounds of formula IX (and preferably those in which Rb represents H or halo) may be prepared from a compound of formula XXII,	or a ?/-protected derivative thereof, wherein J and Ra are as hereinbefore defined, using reagents and procedures known to those skilled in the art, for example such as those hereinbefore described in respect of preparation of compounds of formula I (process route (vi)) or of formula III (process (G)).

Compounds of formula X (or a ?/-protected and/or O-protected (e.g. ester) derivative thereof) in which R1 and J are as hereinbefore defined may also be prepared by oxidation of a compound of formula XXII as hereinbefore defined, under oxidation conditions known to those skilled in the art, for example such as those hereinbefore described in respect of preparation of compounds of formula ill (process step (F)).	Alternatively, compounds of formula X and XXII (or, where applicable, a N-protected and/or O-protected (e.g. ester) derivative thereof) in which R1 and J are as hereinbefore defined may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula XXV,	wherein R1x represents R1 (in the case of preparation of compounds of formula X) or Ra (in the case of preparation of compounds of formula XXII) and J, R1 and Ra are as hereinbefore defined, with an appropriate base (or a mixtures of bases), such as those listed in process (i) above, followed by quenching with an appropriate electrophile such as:	(a) for compounds of formula X, a source of CO2 (e.g. CO2 gas; which addition is followed by the addition of a suitable proton source (e.g.	HCI)), or a compound of formula XIV as hereinbefore defined; or	(b) for compounds of formula XXII, a compound of formula XXVI,	CH3L1d XXVI	or the like (i.e. another suitable methylating reagent), wherein L1d represents a suitable leaving group such as halo (e.g. iodo or bromo) or a sulfonate group (such as -OSO2CF3, OSO2CH3 and -OSO2-aryl (e.g. -O-tosyl)).	Compounds of formula Xl may be prepared by reaction of 1 -aminopyridinium iodide with a compound of formula XXVII,	(R1XCI)C=C(CI)(R2) XXVII	wherein R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined and the geometry of the double bond may be cis or trans, for example under conditions known to those skilled in the art (such as in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. potassium carbonate) and a suitable solvent (e.g. THF)). The skilled person will appreciate that the geometry around the double bond may effect the regioselectivity of the reaction.	Compounds of formula XV in which at least one of -C(R3)=, -C(R4)=, -C(R5)= or -C(R6)= is present in which at least one of R3, R4, R5 and R6 represents X1 in which X1 represents -S(O)2N(R4h)R5h, may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula XXVIII,	XXVIII	or a protected (e.g. at the requisite -OH group) derivative thereof (so forming, for example, a benzyl-protected -OH group), wherein A1x, A2x, A3x and A4x respectively represent A1, A2, A3 and A4 as hereinbefore defined, but in which at least one of -C(R3)=, -C(R4)=, -C(R5)= or -C(R6)= is present in which at least one of R3, R4, R5 and R6 represents -S(O)2CI, with a compound of formula XXIX,	H2N(R4h)R5h XXIX	wherein R4h and R5h are as hereinbefore defined, for example under conditions known to those skilled in the art (for example, such as those hereinbefore described in respect of preparation of compounds of formula V (process step (b)), e.g. in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. triethylamine) and a suitable solvent	(e.g. dichloromethane)). The skilled person will appreciate that a protected derivative (e.g. at the -OH group) of a compound of formula XXVIII may be necessary during either one of the above reaction steps.	Compounds of formula XVIII may be prepared from compounds of formula III (e.g. those in which L3 represents -OH), under dimehsing conditions, for example in the presence of thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride (optionally in the presence of a suitable solvent and catalyst, such as one hereinbefore defined in respect of process step (iii)). Other dimerising reagents include carbodiimides, such as 1 ,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 1 -(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDCI, or hydrochloride thereof) optionally in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. 4-dimethylaminopyridine).	Compounds of formula XXA may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula XXX,	wherein A1, A2, A3 and A4 are as hereinbefore defined, with a compound of formula XXXI,	R1-CH2-C(O)L4 XXXI	wherein R1 and L4 are as hereinbefore defined, in the presence of a suitable base and solvent, and under reaction conditions known to those skilled in the art. For example such conditions may be similar to those described hereinbefore in respect of preparation of compounds of formula I (process step (i) above), e.g. the base may be a metal hydride (e.g. sodium hydride), an amide base (e.g. lithium diisopropylamide) or an organometallic base (such as an organolithium, e.g. n-, s- or NBuLi), or, alternatively, when L4 represents a halo group (e.g. chloro), the reaction may be performed under standard Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction conditions, for instance in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid (e.g.	FeCI31 AICI3, BF3, or the like).	Compounds of formula XXV may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula XXXII,	R1 XXXII	
WO2008129280_0006	wherein R1 and J are as defined hereinbefore, with diazomethane under conditions known to those skilled in the art, for example, in accordance with procedures described in T. Hanamoto et a/., Chom. Commun., 2041 (2005), e.g.	in the presence of a suitable solvent (e.g. hexane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or 1 ,4-dioxane or mixtures thereof) and optionally in the presence of an inert gas.	Compounds of formulae II, Vl, VII, VIII, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XIX, XX, XXB, XXC, XXI, XXIII, XXIV, XXVI, XXVII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXX, XXXI and XXXII are either commercially available, are known in the literature, or may be obtained either by analogy with the processes described herein, or by conventional synthetic procedures, in accordance with standard techniques, from available starting materials using appropriate reagents and reaction conditions. In this respect, the skilled person may refer to inter alia "Comprehensive Organic Synthesis" by B. M. Trost and I. Fleming, Pergamon Press, 1991. Further references that may be employed include "Heterocyclic Chemistry" by J. A. Joule, K. Mills and G. F. Smith, 3rd edition, published by Chapman & Hall, "Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II" by A. R. Katritzky, C. W. Rees and E. F. V. Scriven, Pergamon Press, 1996 and "Science of Synthesis" , Volumes 9-17 (Hetarenes and Related Ring Systems), Georg Thieme Verlag, 2006.	The substituents R1, R2, A1, A2, A3 and A4 as hereinbefore defined may be modified one or more times, after or during the processes described above for preparation of compounds of formula I by way of methods that are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of such methods include substitutions, reductions, oxidations, alkylations, acylations, hydrolyses, esterifications, etherifications, halogenations and nitrations. The precursor groups can be changed to a different such group, or to the groups defined in formula I, at any time during the reaction sequence, in the case where R1 or R2 represents a Cl or F group, such groups may be inter-converted (or converted from another halo group) one or more times, after or during the processes described above for the preparation of compounds of formula I. Appropriate reagents include NiCI2 (for the conversion to a chloro group). The skilled person may also refer to "Comprehensive Organic Functional Group Transformations" by A. R. Katritzky, O. Meth-Cohn and C. W. Rees, Pergamon Press, 1995 and/or "Comprehensive Organic Transformations" by R. C. Larock, Wiley-VCH, 1999.	Other transformations that may be mentioned include the conversion of a halo group (preferably iodo or bromo) to a cyano or 1-alkynyl group (e.g. by reaction with a compound which is a source of cyano anions (e.g. sodium, potassium, copper (I) or zinc cyanide) or with a 1-alkyne, as appropriate). The latter reaction may be performed in the presence of a suitable coupling catalyst (e.g. a palladium and/or a copper based catalyst) and a suitable base (e.g. a tri-(C1-6 alkyl)amine such as thethylamine, tributylamine or ethyldiisopropylamine). Further, amino groups and hydroxy groups may be introduced in accordance with standard conditions using reagents known to those skilled in the art.	Compounds of the invention may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques.	It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, in the processes described above and hereinafter, the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by protecting groups. For example the pyrazole nitrogen may need to be protected. Suitable nitrogen-protecting groups include those which form:	(i) carbamate groups (i.e. alkoxy- or aryloxy-carbonyl groups);	(ii) amide groups (e.g. acetyl groups);	(iii) /V-alkyl groups (e.g. benzyl or SEM groups);	(iv) ?/-sulfonyl groups (e.g. ?/-arylsulfonyl groups);	(v) ?/-phosphinyl and ?/-phosphoryl groups (e g. diarylphosphinyl and diarylphosphoryl groups); or	(vi) ?/-silyl group (e.g. a ?Mrimethylsilyl group).	Further, the skilled person will appreciate that, in the case where there are two functional groups protected (e.g. in the case where the carboxylic acid group of the compound of formula III is an ester and the pyrazole nitrogen is protected with a benzenesulfonyl group, then both groups may be deprotected in one step (e.g. a hydrolysis step known to those skilled in the art).	Further protecting groups for the pyrazole nitrogen include a methyl group, which methyl group may be deprotected under standard conditions, such as employing a pyridine hydrochloride salt at elevated temperature, for example using microwave irradiation in a sealed vessel at 2000C.	The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a reaction in the above-mentioned schemes.	Protecting groups may be removed in accordance with techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art and as described hereinafter. For example, protected compounds/intermediates described herein may be converted chemically to unprotected compounds using standard deprotection techniques.	The type of chemistry involved will dictate the need, and type, of protecting groups as well as the sequence for accomplishing the synthesis.	The use of protecting groups is fully described in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd edition, T.W. Greene & P. G. M. Wutz, Wiley-lnterscience (1999).	Medical and Pharmaceutical Uses	Compounds of the invention are useful because they possess pharmacological activity. Such compounds are therefore indicated as pharmaceuticals. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of formula I, as hereinbefore defined, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, for use as a pharmaceutical and/or in isolated (i.e. ex vivo) form.	Although compounds of the invention may possess pharmacological activity as such, certain pharmaceutically-acceptable (e.g. "protected") derivatives of compounds of the invention may exist or be prepared which may not possess such activity, but may be administered parenteral^ or orally and thereafter be metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention. Such compounds (which may possess some pharmacological activity, provided that such activity is appreciably lower than that of the "active" compounds to which they are metabolised), may therefore be described as "prodrugs" of compounds of the invention. All prodrugs of compounds of the invention are included within the scope of the invention.	By "prodrug of a compound of the invention", we include compounds that form a compound of the invention, in an experimentally-detectable amount, within a predetermined time (e.g. about 1 hour), following oral or parenteral administration.	Compounds of the invention are useful because, in particular, they may inhibit the activity of lipoxygenases (and particularly 15-lipoxygenase), i.e. they prevent the action of 15-lipoxygenase or a complex of which the 15-lipoxygenase enzyme forms a part and/or may elicit a 15-lipoxygenase modulating effect, for example as may be demonstrated in the test described below. Compounds of the invention may thus be useful in the treatment of those conditions in which inhibition of a lipoxygenase, and particularly 15-lipoxygenase, is required.	Compounds of the invention are thus expected to be useful in the treatment of inflammation.	The term "inflammation" will be understood by those skilled in the art to include any condition characterised by a localised or a systemic protective response, which may be elicited by physical trauma, infection, chronic diseases, such as those mentioned hereinbefore, and/or chemical and/or physiological reactions to external stimuli (e.g. as part of an allergic response). Any such response, which may serve to destroy, dilute or sequester both the injurious agent and the injured tissue, may be manifest by, for example, heat, swelling, pain, redness, dilation of blood vessels and/or increased blood flow, invasion of the affected area by white blood cells, loss of function and/or any other symptoms known to be associated with inflammatory conditions.	The term "inflammation" will thus also be understood to include any inflammatory disease, disorder or condition per se, any condition that has an inflammatory component associated with it, and/or any condition characterised by inflammation as a symptom, including inter alia acute, chronic, ulcerative, specific, allergic and necrotic inflammation, and other forms of inflammation known to those skilled in the art. The term thus also includes, for the purposes of this invention, inflammatory pain and/or fever.	Where a condition has an inflammatory component associated with it, or a condition characterised by inflammation as a symptom, the skilled person will appreciate that compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of the inflammatory symptoms and/or the inflammation associated with the condition.	Accordingly, compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, allergic disorders, rhinitis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcers, inflammatory pain, fever, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, vasculitis, pancreatitis, arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis, uveitis, wound healing, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, stroke, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's disease and other malignancies, and any other disease with an inflammatory component.	Compounds of the invention may also have effects that are not linked to inflammatory mechanisms, such as in the reduction of bone loss in a subject. Conditions that may be mentioned in this regard include osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, Paget's disease and/or periodontal diseases. Compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may thus also be useful in increasing bone mineral density, as well as the reduction in incidence and/or healing of fractures, in subjects.	Compounds of the invention are indicated both in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of the above-mentioned conditions.	According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of treatment of a disease which is associated with, and/or which can be modulated by inhibition of, a lipoxygenase (such as 15-lipoxygenase), and/or a method of treatment of a disease in which inhibition of the activity of a lipoxygenase, and particularly 15-lipoxygenase, is desired and/or required (e.g. inflammation), which method comprises administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined but without the proviso, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, to a patient suffering from, or susceptible to, such a condition.	"Patients" include mammalian (including human) patients.	The term "effective amount" refers to an amount of a compound, which confers a therapeutic effect on the treated patient. The effect may be objective (i.e. measurable by some test or marker) or subjective (i.e. the subject gives an indication of or feels an effect).	Compounds of the invention will normally be administered orally, intravenously, subcutaneously, buccally, rectally, dermally, nasally, tracheally, bronchially, sublingually, by any other parenteral route or via inhalation, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form.	Compounds of the invention may be administered alone, but are preferably administered by way of known pharmaceutical formulations, including tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration, suppositories for rectal administration, sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral or intramuscular administration, and the like.	Such formulations may be prepared in accordance with standard and/or accepted pharmaceutical practice.	According to a further aspect of the invention there is thus provided a pharmaceutical formulation including a compound of formula I1 as hereinbefore defined, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.	Depending on e.g. potency and physical characteristics of the compound of the invention (i.e. active ingredient), pharmaceutical formulations that may be mentioned include those in which the active ingredient is present in at least 1 % (or at least 10%, at least 30% or at least 50%) by weight. That is, the ratio of active ingredient to the other components (i.e. the addition of adjuvant, diluent and carrier) of the pharmaceutical composition is at least 1 :99 (or at least 10:90, at least 30:70 or at least 50:50) by weight.	The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation, as hereinbefore defined, which process comprises bringing into association a compound of formula I, as hereinbefore defined, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.	Compounds of the invention may also be combined with other therapeutic agents that are useful in the treatment of inflammation as defined herein (e.g. glucocorticoids or, preferably, NSAIDs, coxibs, corticosteroids, analgesics, inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase, inhibitors of FLAP (5-lipoxygenase activating protein), and leukothene receptor antagonists (LTRas), and/or other therapeutic agents that are useful in the treatment of inflammation).	According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a combination product comprising:	(A) a compound of formula I1 as hereinbefore defined (but, for example, without the proviso), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof; and (B) another therapeutic agent that is useful in the treatment of inflammation, wherein each of components (A) and (B) is formulated in admixture with a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.	Such combination products provide for the administration of compound of the invention in conjunction with the other therapeutic agent, and may thus be presented either as separate formulations, wherein at least one of those formulations comprises compound of the invention and at least one comprises the other therapeutic agent, or may be presented (i.e. formulated) as a combined preparation (i.e. presented as a single formulation including compound of the invention and the other therapeutic agent).	Thus, there is further provided:	(1) a pharmaceutical formulation including a compound of formula I1 as hereinbefore defined (but, for example, without the proviso), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, another therapeutic agent that is useful in the treatment of inflammation, and a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier; and	(2) a kit of parts comprising components: (a) a pharmaceutical formulation including a compound of formula I1 as hereinbefore defined (but, for example, without the proviso), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier; and	(b) a pharmaceutical formulation including another therapeutic agent that is useful in the treatment of inflammation in admixture with a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier,	which components (a) and (b) are each provided in a form that is suitable for administration in conjunction with the other.	The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a combination product as hereinbefore defined, which process comprises bringing into association a compound of formula I, as hereinbefore defined (but, for example, without the proviso), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with the other therapeutic agent that is useful in the treatment of inflammation, and at least one pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.	
WO2008129280_0007	By "bringing into association", we mean that the two components are rendered suitable for administration in conjunction with each other.	Thus, in relation to the process for the preparation of a kit of parts as hereinbefore defined, by bringing the two components "into association with" each other, we include that the two components of the kit of parts may be:	(i) provided as separate formulations (i.e. independently of one another), which are subsequently brought together for use in conjunction with each other in combination therapy; or	(ii) packaged and presented together as separate components of a "combination pack" for use in conjunction with each other in combination therapy.	Compounds of the invention may be administered at varying doses. Oral, pulmonary and topical dosages may range from between about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 100 mg/kg/day, preferably about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg/day, and more preferably about 0.1 to about 5.0 mg/kg/day. For e.g. oral administration, the compositions typically contain between about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg, and preferably between about 1 mg to about 100 mg, of the active ingredient. Intravenously, preferred doses will range from about 0.001 to about 10 mg/kg/hour during constant rate infusion. Advantageously, compounds may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily.	In any event, the physician, or the skilled person, will be able to determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient, which is likely to vary with the route of administration, the type and severity of the condition that is to be treated, as well as the species, age, weight, sex, renal function, hepatic function and response of the particular patient to be treated. The above-mentioned dosages are exemplary of the average case; there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.	Compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are effective and/or selective inhibitors of lipoxygenases, and particularly 15-lipoxygenase.	Compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be more efficacious than, be less toxic than, be longer acting than, be more potent than, produce fewer side effects than, be more easily absorbed than, and/or have a better pharmacokinetic profile (e.g. higher oral bioavailability and/or lower clearance) than, and/or have other useful pharmacological, physical, or chemical properties over, compounds known in the prior art, whether for use in the stated indications or otherwise.	Biological Test	The assay employed takes advantage of the ability of lipoxygenases to oxidize polyunsaturated fatty acids, containing a 1 ,4-cis-pentadiene configuration, to their corresponding hydroperoxy or hydroxyl derivatives. In this particular assay, the lipoxygenase was a purified human 15-lipoxygenase and the fatty acid was arachidonic acid. The assay is performed at room temperature (20-220C) and the following are added to each well in a 96-well microtiter plate:	a) 35 µL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4);	b) inhibitor (i.e. compound) or vehicle (0.5 µl DMSO);	c) 10 µL of a 10 x concentrated solution of 15-lipoxygenase in PBS. The plates are incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature;	d) 5 µl of 0.125 mM arachidonic acid in PBS. The plate is then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature;	e) the enzymatic reaction is terminated by the addition of 100 µl methanol; and f) the amount of 15-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid or 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid is measured by reverse phase HPLC.	The invention is illustrated by way of the following examples, in which the following abbreviations may be employed:	aq. aqueous	BuLi n-butyllithium	EtOAc ethyl acetate	EtOH ethanol	MS mass spectrum	NMR nuclear magnetic resonance	PCA pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid	sat. saturated	THF tetrahydrofuran	Chemicals specified in the synthesis of the compounds in the examples were commercially available from, e.g. Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemicals.	Unless otherwise stated, one or more tautomeric forms of compounds of the examples described hereinafter may be prepared in situ and/or isolated. All tautomeric forms of compounds of the examples described hereinafter should be considered to be disclosed.	Synthesis of intermediates:	5-Chloropyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (I)	The title compound may be prepared from two alternative methods:	Method A	(a) 5-Chloro-3-methylpyrazole	A mixture of 5-chloro-1 ,3-dimethylpyrazole (2.6 mmol) and pyridine hydrochloride (13.1 mmol) in a sealed 5 mL process vial was heated using microwave irradiation for 2 h at 2000C. After cooling to room temperature, EtOAc (15 mL) was added and the mixture was washed with HCI (aq., 2M; 1 OmL), NaCI (sat., aq.), dried (MgSO4) and concentrated to afford the sub-title compound as a white solid (Yield: 210 mg (67%)).	MS (M++H) m/z = 1 17.	1H-NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz), d 12.66 (br s, 1 H), 6.03 (m, 1 H), 2.19 (s, 3H).	(b) d-Chloropyrazole-S-carboxylic acid	A mixture of 5-chloro-3-methylpyrazole (3.6 mmol; see step (a) above), water (6 mL) and terf-butanol (1.2 mL) was heated to 750C, after which KMnO4 (1.42 g, 9 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at 75°C overnight and filtered hot. The solids were washed with boiling water. The combined cooled filtrates were extracted with EtOAc, and the combined extracts washed with NaCI (sat., aq.), dried (MgSO4) and concentrated.

[002] Disclosed herein are new heterobicyclic-substituted quinolone compounds and compositions and their application as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease.	Methods of inhibition of nitric oxide synthase activity in a human or animal subject are also provided for the treatment disease.	[003] Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the regulation of many physiological	processes as well as the pathophysiology of a number of diseases. It is synthesized	enzymatically from L-arginine in numerous tissues and cell types by three distinct	isoforms of the enzyme NO synthase (NOS). Two of these isoforms, endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS) are expressed in a constitutive manner and are	calcium/calmodulin dependent. Endothelial NOS is expressed by endothelium and	other cell types and is involved in cardiovascular homeostasis. Neuronal NOS is	constitutively present in both the central and peripheral nervous system where NO acts a neurotransmitter. Under normal physiological conditions, these constitutive forms of NOS generate low, transient levels of NO in response to increases in intracellular	calcium concentrations. These low levels of NO act to regulate blood pressure, platelet adhesion, gastrointestinal motility, bronchomotor tone and neurotransmission.	[004] In contrast, the third isoform of NOS, inducible NOS (iNOS), a virtually	calcium independent enzyme, is absent in resting cells, but is rapidly expressed in	virtually all nucleated mammalian cells in response to stimuli such as endotoxins	and/or cytokines. The inducible isoform is neither stimulated by calcium nor blocked by calmodulin antagonists. It contains several tightly bound co-factors, including	FMN, FAD and tetrahydrobiopterin. The inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	(NOS2 or iNOS) is expressed in virtually all nucleated mammalian cells following	exposure to inflammatory cytokines or lipopolysaccharide.	[005] The enzyme iNOS synthase is a homodimer composed of 130 kDa subunits.	Each subunit comprises an oxygenase domain and a reductase domain. Importantly,	
WO2009029625_0002	dimerization of the iNOS synthase is required for enzyme activity. If the dimerization mechanism is disrupted, the production of nitric oxide via inducible NOS enzyme is	inhibited.	[006] The presence of iNOS in macrophages and lung epithelial cells is	significant. Once present, iNOS synthesizes 100-1000 times more NO than the	constitutive enzymes synthesize and does so for prolonged periods. This excessive	production of NO and resulting NO-derived metabolites (e.g., peroxynitrite) elicit	cellular toxicity and tissue damage which contribute to the pathophysiology of a	number of diseases, disorders and conditions.	[007] Nitric oxide generated by the inducible form of NOS has also been	implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. In experimental animals,	hypotension induced by lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor alpha can be	reversed by NOS inhibitors. Conditions which lead to cytokine-induced hypotension	include septic shock, hemodialysis and interleukin therapy in cancer patients. An	iNOS inhibitor has been shown to be effective in treating cytokine-induced	hypotension, inflammatory bowel disease, cerebral ischemia, osteoarthritis, asthma and neuropathies such as diabetic neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia.	[008] In addition, nitric oxide localized in high amounts in inflamed tissues has	been shown to induce pain locally and to enhance central as well as peripheral stimuli.	Because nitric oxide produced by an inflammatory response is thought to be	synthesized by iNOS, the inhibition of iNOS dimerization produces both prophylactic and remedial analgesia in patients. Nitric oxide and NOS activity and expression have been linked to neuropathic pain and postherpetic neuralgia, as well, conditions for	which treatment options have been equivocal at best(Wu CL and Raja SN, J Pain.	2008 Jan;9(l Suppl l):S19-30). Inhibitors of iNOS show promise in the treatment of	these debilitating diseases. By way of example, several recent studies in rats	administered an iNOS inhibitor demonstrate a role for peripherally-expressed iNOS in Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	pain conditions with an inflammatory component and the potential value of iNOS	inhibitors in such conditions. In one, rats administered iNOS inhibitor GW274150 24 hours after Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) injection in the hind paw demonstrated suppressed accumulation of nitrite in the inflamed paw indicating substantial iNOS	inhibition and attenuated hypersensitivity to pain and edema in a dose-dependent	manner (De Alba J et al, J Pain. 2006 Jan; 120(1 -2): 170-81). In another, evidence for local NOS expression and NO action in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain was demonstrated (Levy D and Zochodne DW, Eur J Neurosci. 1998 May; 10 (5):1846-55), and administration of GW274150 following chronic constrictive injury surgery reversed significantly the CCI-associated hypersensitivity to pain (De	Alba J et al., ] Pain. 2006 Jan; 120 (1-2): 170-81).	[009] INOS-selective and nonselective inhibitors have long been known in the art, and have been investigated for the treatment of iNOS-mediated diseases and conditions including pain, as described above. In situations where the overproduction of nitric oxide is deleterious, it makes logical sense to pursue an inhibitor of iNOS to reduce the production of NO, thereby relieving inflammation, pain, and other NO-mediated	diseases. To date, however, no NOS inhibitor has made it to market, for reasons that	will not be exhaustively addressed here. The earliest compounds tended to fall in to	the category of active-site inhibitors, leading to unacceptable side effects. As the	important physiological roles played by the constitutive NOS isoforms, particularly	eNOS, became more clear, later compounds were designed to have isoform selectivity to ensure that the inhibition of iNOS has the least possible effect on the activity of	eNOS. Other agents failed to have pharmacokinetic properties suitable for orally- administered agents that will have good patient compliance. What is clear is that a	need still exists for a selective, effective, pharmacologically appropriate inhibitor of	iNOS.	[010] Novel compounds and pharmaceutical compositions, certain of which have been found to inhibit inducible NOS synthase have been discovered, together with	methods of synthesizing and using the compounds including methods for the treatment of iNOS-mediated diseases in a patient by administering the compounds. Certain of Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	these compounds have additionally demonstrated efficacy in vivo as anti-inflammatory agents.

[088] The terms "sulfonate," "sulfonic acid," and "sulfonic," as used herein, alone or in combination, refer to the -SO3H group and its anion as the sulfonic acid is used in salt formation.	[089] The term "sulfanyl," as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to -S-.	[090] The term "sulfmyl," as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to	-S(O)-.	Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	[091] The term "sulfonyl," as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to - S(O)2-.	[092] The term "N-sulfonamido" refers to a RS(=O)2NR'- group with R and R' as defined herein.	[093] The term "S-sulfonamido" refers to a -S(=O)2NRR' , group, with R and R' as defined herein.	[094] The terms "thia" and "thio," as used herein, alone or in combination, refer to a -S- group or an ether wherein the oxygen is replaced with sulfur. The oxidized	derivatives of the thio group, namely sulfmyl and sulfonyl, are included in the	definition of thia and thio.	[095] The term "thiol," as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to an -SH group.	[096] The term "thiocarbonyl," as used herein, when alone includes thioformyl - C(S)H and in combination is a -C(S)- group.	[097] The term "N-thiocarbamyl" refers to an ROC(S)NR'- group, with R and R' as defined herein.	[098] The term "O-thiocarbamyl" refers to a -OC(S)NRR', group with R and R' as defined herein.	[099] The term "thiocyanato" refers to a -CNS group.	[0100] The term "trihalomethoxy" refers to a X3CO- group where X is a halogen.	[0101] The term "trisubstituted silyl," as used herein, alone or in combination,	refers to a silicone group substituted at its three free valences with groups as listed	herein under the definition of substituted amino. Examples include trimethysilyl, tert- butyldimethylsilyl, triphenylsilyl and the like.	[0102] Any definition herein may be used in combination with any other definition to describe a composite structural group. By convention, the trailing element of any	such definition is that which attaches to the parent moiety. For example, the composite group alkylamido would represent an alkyl group attached to the parent molecule	through an amido group, and the term alkoxyalkyl would represent an alkoxy group	attached to the parent molecule through an alkyl group.	Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	[0103] When a group is defined to be "null," what is meant is that said group is	absent.	
WO2009029625_0009	[0104] The term "optionally substituted" means the anteceding group may be	substituted or unsubstituted. When substituted, the substituents of an "optionally substituted" group may include, without limitation, one or more substituents	independently selected from the following groups or a particular designated set of	groups, alone or in combination: lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, lower	alkanoyl, lower heteroalkyl, lower heterocycloalkyl, lower haloalkyl, lower	haloalkenyl, lower haloalkynyl, lower perhaloalkyl, lower perhaloalkoxy, lower	cycloalkyl, phenyl, aryl, aryloxy, lower alkoxy, lower haloalkoxy, oxo, lower acyloxy, carbonyl, carboxyl, lower alkylcarbonyl, lower carboxyester, lower carboxamido,	cyano, hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, amino, lower alkylamino, arylamino, amido, nitro, thiol, lower alkylthio, lower haloalkylthio, lower perhaloalkylthio, arylthio, sulfonate, sulfonic acid, trisubstituted silyl, N3, SH, SCH3, C(O)CH3, CO2CH3, CO2H, pyridinyl, thiophene, furanyl, lower carbamate, and lower urea. Two substituents may be joined together to form a fused five-, six-, or seven-membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring consisting of zero to three heteroatoms, for example forming methylenedioxy or	ethylenedioxy. An optionally substituted group may be unsubstituted (e.g., -CH2CH3), fully substituted (e.g., -CF2CF3), monosubstituted (e.g., -CH2CH2F) or substituted at a level anywhere in-between fully substituted and monosubstituted (e.g., -CH2CF3).	Where substituents are recited without qualification as to substitution, both substituted and unsubstituted forms are encompassed. Where a substituent is qualified as	"substituted," the substituted form is specifically intended. Additionally, different sets of optional substituents to a particular moiety may be defined as needed; in these cases, the optional substitution will be as defined, often immediately following the phrase,	"optionally substituted with."	[0105] The term R or the term R' , appearing by itself and without a number	designation, unless otherwise defined, refers to a moiety selected from the group	consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl and	heterocycloalkyl, any of which may be optionally substituted. Such R and R' groups	should be understood to be optionally substituted as defined herein. Whether an R Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	group has a number designation or not, every R group, including R, R' and Rn where	n=(l, 2, 3, ...n), every substituent, and every term should be understood to be	independent of every other in terms of selection from a group. Should any variable,	substituent, or term (e.g. aryl, heterocycle, R, etc.) occur more than one time in a	formula or generic structure, its definition at each occurrence is independent of the	definition at every other occurrence. Those of skill in the art will further recognize that certain groups may be attached to a parent molecule or may occupy a position in a	chain of elements from either end as written. Thus, by way of example only, an	unsymmetrical group such as -C(O)N(R)- may be attached to the parent moiety at	either the carbon or the nitrogen.	[0106] Asymmetric centers exist in the compounds disclosed herein. These centers are designated by the symbols "R" or "S," depending on the configuration of	substituents around the chiral carbon atom. It should be understood that the invention	encompasses all stereochemical isomeric forms, including diastereomeric,	enantiomeric, and epimeric forms, as well as d-isomers and 1 -isomers, and mixtures	thereof. Individual stereoisomers of compounds can be prepared synthetically from	commercially available starting materials which contain chiral centers or by	preparation of mixtures of enantiomeric products followed by separation such as	conversion to a mixture of diastereomers followed by separation or recrystallization,	chromatographic techniques, direct separation of enantiomers on chiral	chromatographic columns, or any other appropriate method known in the art. Starting compounds of particular stereochemistry are either commercially available or can be	made and resolved by techniques known in the art. Additionally, the compounds	disclosed herein may exist as geometric isomers. The present invention includes all	cis, trans, syn, anti, entgegen (E), and zusammen (Z) isomers as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. Additionally, compounds may exist as tautomers; all tautomeric	isomers are provided by this invention. Additionally, the compounds disclosed herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable	solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. In general, the solvated forms are	considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms.	Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	[0107] The term "bond" refers to a covalent linkage between two atoms, or two	moieties when the atoms joined by the bond are considered to be part of larger	substructure. A bond may be single, double, or triple unless otherwise specified. A	dashed line between two atoms in a drawing of a molecule indicates that an additional bond may be present or absent at that position.	[0108] The term "disease" as used herein is intended to be generally synonymous, and is used interchangeably with, the terms "disorder" and "condition" (as in medical condition), in that all reflect an abnormal condition of the human or animal body or of one of its parts that impairs normal functioning, is typically manifested by	distinguishing signs and symptoms, and causes the human or animal to have a reduced duration or quality of life.	
WO2009029625_0010	[0109] The term "combination therapy" means the administration of two or more therapeutic agents to treat a therapeutic condition or disorder described in the present disclosure. Such administration encompasses co-administration of these therapeutic	agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single capsule having a	fixed ratio of active ingredients or in multiple, separate capsules for each active	ingredient. In addition, such administration also encompasses use of each type of	therapeutic agent in a sequential manner. In either case, the treatment regimen will	provide beneficial effects of the drug combination in treating the conditions or	disorders described herein.	[0110] "iNOS inhibitor" is used herein to refer to a compound that exhibits an IC50 with respect to iNOS activity of no more than about 100 µM and more typically not	more than about 50 µM, as measured in the iNOS assay described generally	hereinbelow. "IC50" is that concentration of inhibitor which reduces the activity of an enzyme (e.g., iNOS) to half-maximal level. Certain compounds disclosed herein have been discovered to exhibit inhibition against iNOS. In certain embodiments,	compounds will exhibit an EC50 with respect to iNOS of no more than about 10 µM; in further embodiments, compounds will exhibit an EC50 with respect to iNOS of no more than about 5 µM; in yet further embodiments, compounds will exhibit an EC50 with	respect to iNOS of not more than about 1 µM; in yet further embodiments, compounds Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	will exhibit an EC50 with respect to iNOS of not more than about 200 nM, as measured in the iNOS assay described herein.	[0111] The phrase "therapeutically effective" is intended to qualify the amount of active ingredients used in the treatment of a disease or disorder. This amount will	achieve the goal of reducing or eliminating the said disease or disorder.	[0112] The term "therapeutically acceptable" refers to those compounds (or salts, prodrugs, tautomers, zwitterionic forms, etc.) which are suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, and allergic response, are	commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and are effective for their intended use.	[0113] As used herein, reference to "treatment" of a patient is intended to include prophylaxis. The term "patient" means all mammals including humans. Examples of patients include humans, cows, dogs, cats, goats, sheep, pigs, and rabbits. Preferably, the patient is a human.	[0114] The term "prodrug" refers to a compound that is made more active in vivo.	Certain compounds disclosed herein may also exist as prodrugs, as described in	Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism : Chemistry, Biochemistry, and	Enzymology (Testa, Bernard and Mayer, Joachim M. Wiley- VHC A, Zurich,	Switzerland 2003). Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are structurally	modified forms of the compound that readily undergo chemical changes under	physiological conditions to provide the compound. Additionally, prodrugs can be	converted to the compound by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo	environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to a compound when	placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.	Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the compound, or parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral	administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved	solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. A wide variety of	prodrug derivatives are known in the art, such as those that rely on hydrolytic cleavage or oxidative activation of the prodrug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug	would be a compound which is administered as an ester (the "prodrug"), but then is Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity. Additional examples include peptidyl derivatives of a compound.	[0115] The compounds disclosed herein can exist as therapeutically acceptable	salts. The present invention includes compounds listed above in the form of salts,	including acid addition salts. Suitable salts include those formed with both organic and inorganic acids. Such acid addition salts will normally be pharmaceutically acceptable.	However, salts of non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be of utility in the	preparation and purification of the compound in question. Basic addition salts may	also be formed and be pharmaceutically acceptable. For a more complete discussion of the preparation and selection of salts, refer to Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties,	Selection, and Use (Stahl, P. Heinrich. Wiley- VCHA, Zurich, Switzerland, 2002).	[0116] The term "therapeutically acceptable salt," as used herein, represents salts or zwitterionic forms of the compounds disclosed herein which are water or oil-soluble or dispersible and therapeutically acceptable as defined herein. The salts can be	prepared during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or separately by reacting the appropriate compound in the form of the free base with a suitable acid.	Representative acid addition salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, L-ascorbate,	aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate (besylate), bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate,	camphorsulfonate, citrate, digluconate, formate, fumarate, gentisate, glutarate,	glycerophosphate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hippurate,	hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate (isethionate),	lactate, maleate, malonate, DL-mandelate, mesitylenesulfonate, methanesulfonate,	naphthylenesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylproprionate, phosphonate, picrate, pivalate, propionate,	
WO2009029625_0011	pyroglutamate, succinate, sulfonate, tartrate, L-tartrate, trichloroacetate,	trifluoroacetate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, para-toluenesulfonate (p-tosylate), and undecanoate. Also, basic groups in the compounds disclosed herein can be	quaternized with methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides;	dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates; decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and steryl	chlorides, bromides, and iodides; and benzyl and phenethyl bromides. Examples of	acids which can be employed to form therapeutically acceptable addition salts include Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, and phosphoric, and	organic acids such as oxalic, maleic, succinic, and citric. Salts can also be formed by	coordination of the compounds with an alkali metal or alkaline earth ion. Hence, the	present invention contemplates sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium salts of	the compounds disclosed herein, and the like.	[0117] Basic addition salts can be prepared during the final isolation and	purification of the compounds by reacting a carboxy group with a suitable base such as the hydroxide, carbonate, or bicarbonate of a metal cation or with ammonia or an	organic primary, secondary, or tertiary amine. The cations of therapeutically acceptable salts include lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum, as well as nontoxic quaternary amine cations such as ammonium, tetramethylammonium,	tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine,	diethylamine, ethylamine, tributylamine, pyridine, JV,iV-dimethylaniline, N- methylpiperidine, JV-methylmorpholine, dicyclohexylamine, procaine, dibenzylamine, ?/,?/-dibenzylphenethylamine, 1-ephenamine, and iV.?/'-dibenzylethylenediamme. Other representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include	ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine, and piperazine.	[0118] While it may be possible for the compounds of the subject invention to be	administered as the raw chemical, it is also possible to present them as a	pharmaceutical formulation. Accordingly, provided herein are pharmaceutical	formulations which comprise one or more of certain compounds disclosed herein, or	one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, prodrugs, amides, or solvates	thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and	optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be	"acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the	formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Proper formulation is	dependent upon the route of administration chosen. Any of the well-known	techniques, carriers, and excipients may be used as suitable and as understood in the	art; e.g., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be manufactured in any manner known in the art, e.g. , by means Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating,	emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or compression processes.	[0119] The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including	subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarticular, and	intramedullary), intraperitoneal, transmucosal, transdermal, rectal and topical	(including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular) administration although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the	recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and	may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Typically, these methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of the subject invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide, prodrug or solvate thereof ("active ingredient") with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory	ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately	bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided	solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired	formulation.	[0120] Formulations of the compounds disclosed herein suitable for oral	administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets	each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or	granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in- water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active	ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.	[0121] Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include tablets,	push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. Tablets may be made by compression or	molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may	be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free- flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with binders, inert	
WO2009029625_0012	diluents, or lubricating, surface active or dispersing agents. Molded tablets may be	made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound	moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active	ingredient therein. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages	suitable for such administration. The push- fit capsules can contain the active	ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or	lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft	capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose,	concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or	pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to	characterize different combinations of active compound doses.	[0122] The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by	injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection	may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers,	with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions,	solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. The formulations may be	presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in powder form or in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or sterile pyrogen- free water, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions	may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously	described.	[0123] Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and nonaqueous (oily) sterile injection solutions of the active compounds which may contain	antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic	with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile	suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Suitable	lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection	suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension,	such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the	suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.	[0124] In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may	also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be	administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by	intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with	suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an	acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.	[0125] For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the	form of tablets, lozenges, pastilles, or gels formulated in conventional manner. Such	compositions may comprise the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose	and acacia or tragacanth.	[0126] The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as	suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, or other glycerides.	[0127] Certain compounds disclosed herein may be administered topically, that is by non-systemic administration. This includes the application of a compound disclosed herein externally to the epidermis or the buccal cavity and the instillation of such a	compound into the ear, eye and nose, such that the compound does not significantly	enter the blood stream. In contrast, systemic administration refers to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration.	[0128] Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi- liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of inflammation such as gels, liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and drops suitable for	administration to the eye, ear or nose. The active ingredient for topical administration may comprise, for example, from 0.001% to 10% w/w (by weight) of the formulation.	In certain embodiments, the active ingredient may comprise as much as 10% w/w. In Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	other embodiments, it may comprise less than 5% w/w. In certain embodiments, the	active ingredient may comprise from 2% w/w to 5% w/w. In other embodiments, it	may comprise from 0.1% to 1% w/w of the formulation.	
WO2009029625_0013	[0129] Gels for topical or transdermal administration may comprise, generally, a	mixture of volatile solvents, nonvolatile solvents, and water. In certain embodiments, the volatile solvent component of the buffered solvent system may include lower (Cl- C6) alkyl alcohols, lower alkyl glycols and lower glycol polymers. In further	embodiments, the volatile solvent is ethanol. The volatile solvent component is	thought to act as a penetration enhancer, while also producing a cooling effect on the	skin as it evaporates. The nonvolatile solvent portion of the buffered solvent system is selected from lower alkylene glycols and lower glycol polymers. In certain	embodiments, propylene glycol is used. The nonvolatile solvent slows the evaporation of the volatile solvent and reduces the vapor pressure of the buffered solvent system.	The amount of this nonvolatile solvent component, as with the volatile solvent, is	determined by the pharmaceutical compound or drug being used. When too little of the nonvolatile solvent is in the system, the pharmaceutical compound may crystallize due to evaporation of volatile solvent, while an excess may result in a lack of	bioavailability due to poor release of drug from solvent mixture. The buffer	component of the buffered solvent system may be selected from any buffer commonly used in the art; in certain embodiments, water is used. A common ratio of ingredients is about 20% of the nonvolatile solvent, about 40% of the volatile solvent, and about	40% water. There are several optional ingredients which can be added to the topical	composition. These include, but are not limited to, chelators and gelling agents.	Appropriate gelling agents can include, but are not limited to, semisynthetic cellulose derivatives (such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) and synthetic polymers, and	cosmetic agents.	[0130] Lotions include those suitable for application to the skin or eye. An eye	lotion may comprise a sterile aqueous solution optionally containing a bactericide and may be prepared by methods similar to those for the preparation of drops. Lotions or	liniments for application to the skin may also include an agent to hasten drying and to Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	cool the skin, such as an alcohol or acetone, and/or a moisturizer such as glycerol or an oil such as castor oil or arachis oil.	[0131] Creams, ointments or pastes are semi-solid formulations of the active	ingredient for external application. They may be made by mixing the active ingredient in finely-divided or powdered form, alone or in solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous fluid, with the aid of suitable machinery, with a greasy or non-greasy	base. The base may comprise hydrocarbons such as hard, soft or liquid paraffin,	glycerol, beeswax, a metallic soap; a mucilage; an oil of natural origin such as almond, corn, arachis, castor or olive oil; wool fat or its derivatives or a fatty acid such as	stearic or oleic acid together with an alcohol such as propylene glycol or a macrogel.	The formulation may incorporate any suitable surface active agent such as an anionic, cationic or non-ionic surfactant such as a sorbitan ester or a polyoxyethylene derivative thereof. Suspending agents such as natural gums, cellulose derivatives or inorganic	materials such as silicaceous silicas, and other ingredients such as lanolin, may also be included.	[0132] Drops may comprise sterile aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions and	may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a suitable aqueous solution of a bactericidal and/or fungicidal agent and/or any other suitable preservative, and, in	certain embodiments, including a surface active agent. The resulting solution may then be clarified by filtration, transferred to a suitable container which is then sealed and	sterilized by autoclaving or maintaining at 98-1000C for half an hour. Alternatively, the solution may be sterilized by filtration and transferred to the container by an aseptic	technique. Examples of bactericidal and fungicidal agents suitable for inclusion in the drops are phenylmercuric nitrate or acetate (0.002%), benzalkonium chloride (0.01%) and chlorhexidine acetate (0.01%). Suitable solvents for the preparation of an oily	solution include glycerol, diluted alcohol and propylene glycol.	[0133] Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis	such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.	Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	[0134] For administration by inhalation, compounds may be conveniently delivered from an insufflator, nebulizer pressurized packs or other convenient means of	delivering an aerosol spray. Pressurized packs may comprise a suitable propellant such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Alternatively, for	administration by inhalation or insufflation, the compounds according to the invention may take the form of a dry powder composition, for example a powder mix of the	compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The powder	composition may be presented in unit dosage form, in for example, capsules,	cartridges, gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may be administered with	the aid of an inhalator or insufflator.	[0135] Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, as herein below recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.	[0136] It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly	mentioned above, the formulations described above may include other agents	conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for	example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.	[0137] Compounds may be administered orally or via injection at a dose of from	0.1 to 500 mg/kg per day. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete	units may conveniently contain an amount of one or more compounds which is	effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5	
WO2009029625_0014	mg to 500 mg, usually around 10 mg to 200 mg.	[0138] The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier	materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated	and the particular mode of administration.	[0139] The compounds can be administered in various modes, e.g. orally, topically, or by injection. The precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. The specific dose level for any particular	patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific	compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diets, time of Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the precise disorder being treated, and the severity of the indication or condition being treated.	Also, the route of administration may vary depending on the condition and its severity.	[0140] In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one of the compounds described herein (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or prodrug	thereof) in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if	one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein is hypertension, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-hypertensive	agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be	enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may only have	minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the	overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit of experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the	compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a	therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit.

The other compounds listed above, which have not yet been made and/or tested, are predicted to have activity in these assays as well.	Biological Activity Assay	Enzyme Source	[0240] The source of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme can be generated in	several ways including induction of endogenous iNOS using cytokines and/or	lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in various cell types known in the art. Alternatively, the	gene encoding the enzyme can be cloned and the enzyme can be generated in cells via heterologous expression from a transient or stable expression plasmid with suitable	features for protein expression as are known in the art. Enzymatic activity (nitric oxide production) is calcium independent for iNOS, while the constitutive NOS isoforms,	nNOS and eNOS, become active with the addition of various cofactors added to	cellular media or extract as are well known in the art. Enzymes specified in Table 1	were expressed in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with human iNOS.	DAN Assay	[0241] A major metabolic pathway for nitric oxide is to nitrate and nitrite, which	are stable metabolites within tissue culture, tissue, plasma, and urine (S Moncada, A	Higgs, N Eng J Med 329, 2002 (1993)). Tracer studies in humans have demonstrated that perhaps 50% of the total body nitrate/nitrite originates from the substrate for NO	synthesis, L-arginine (PM Rhodes, AM Leone, PL Francis, AD Struthers, S Moncada, Biomed Biophys Res. Commun. 209, 590 (1995); L. Castillo et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90, 193 (1993). Although nitrate and nitrite are not measures of biologically	active NO, plasma and urine samples obtained from subjects after a suitable period of fasting, and optionally after administration of a controlled diet (low nitrate/low Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	arginine), allow the use of nitrate and nitrite as an index of NO activity (C Baylis, P	Vallance, Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens 7, 59 (1998)).	[0242] The level of nitrate or nitrite in the specimen can be quantified by any	method known in the art which provides adequate sensitivity and reproducibility. A	variety of protocols have also been described for detecting and quantifying nitrite and nitrate levels in biological fluids by ion chromatography (e.g., SA Everett et al., J.	Chromatogr. 706, 437 (1995); JM Monaghan et al., J. Chromatogr. 770, 143 (1997)), high-performance liquid chromatography (e.g., M KeIm et al., Cardiovasc. Res. 41,	765 (1999)), and capillary electrophoresis (MA Friedberg et al., J. Chromatogr. 781,	491 (1997)). For example, 2,3-diaminonaphthalene reacts with the nitrosonium cation that forms spontaneously from NO to form the fluorescent product lH-naphthotriazole.	Using 2,3-diaminonaphthalene ("DAN"), researchers have developed a rapid,	quantitative fluorometric assay that can detect from 10 nM to 10 µM nitrite and is	compatible with a multi-well microplate format. DAN is a highly selective	photometric and fluorometric reagent for Se and nitrite ion. DAN reacts with nitrite ion and gives fluorescent naphthotriazole (MC Carre et al., Analusis 27, 835-838	(1999)). Table 1 provides the test results of various compounds of the subject	invention using the DAN assay.	[0243] A specimen can be processed prior to determination of nitrate or nitrite as	required by the quantification method, or in order to improve the results, or for the	convenience of the investigator. For example, processing can involve centrifuging,	filtering, or homogenizing the sample. If the sample is whole blood, the blood can be centrifuged to remove cells and the nitrate or nitrite assay performed on the plasma or serum fraction. If the sample is tissue, the tissue can be dispersed or homogenized by any method known in the art prior to determination of nitrate or nitrite. It may be	preferable to remove cells and other debris by centrifugation or another method and to determine the nitrate or nitrite level using only the fluid portion of the sample, or the	extracellular fluid fraction of the sample. The sample can also be preserved for later	determination, for example by freezing of urine or plasma samples. When appropriate, additives may be introduced into the specimen to preserve or improve its characteristics for use in the nitrate or nitrite assay.	Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	[0244] The "level" of nitrate, nitrite, or other NO-related product usually refers to the concentration (in moles per liter, micromoles per liter, or other suitable units) of	nitrate or nitrite in the specimen, or in the fluid portion of the specimen. However,	
WO2009029625_0028	other units of measure can also be used to express the level of nitrate or nitrite. For	example, an absolute amount (in micrograms, milligrams, nanomoles, moles, or other suitable units) can be used, particularly if the amount refers back to a constant amount (e.g., grams, kilograms, milliliters, liters, or other suitable units) of the specimens	under consideration. A number of commercially available kits can be used. In certain instances two regioisomers correspond to a single example #, whereby the example # is given in Table 1 with two hiNOS activity values respectively.	Table 1. Biological Activity	Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	Pharmacokinetic Assay	Metabolic Stability of Compounds Following Incubation with Male Mouse Liver	Microsomes	[0245] Liver microsomes are subcellular fractions that contain drug-metabolizing	enzymes including the cytochrome P450s (CYPs), flavin monooxygenases and UDP	glucuronyl transferases. These enzymes require exogenous cofactors for activity in this test system. The co-factors used consist of an NADPH regenerating system	(supporting Phase I oxidation) and UDP-GA (supporting Phase II glucuronidation).	The following protocol, employing murine liver microsomes, may be used to determine the in vitro metabolic stability of compounds in terms of half life.	Preparation:	[0246] Potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 (incubation buffer) was prepared	from 110 mL IM KPO4 monobasic and 390 mL of IM KPO4 dibasic (500 mL total	volume), which was diluted with water to 100 mM prior to addition ofl mM EDTA, 3 mM MgCl2 and 1.25 mM D-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone monohydrate. May be stored	for up to one month at 4°C. One day prior to study, to 200 mL of incubation buffer	was added 5 mg alamethicin and 0.21 g bovine serum albumin (BSA), with 2 min of	sonication and several hours of stirring. In 15 mL polypropylene screw-cap tubes	containing 8.5 mL incubation buffer, 40 µL of compound in DMSO at 1.25 mM was	added to yield a 5.88 µM solution (test article). Liver microsomes (male CD-I mouse liver microsomes from, e.g., BD Gentest, Woburn, MA; may be stored at -700C until use) at a concentration of 20 mg/mL were diluted to 5 mg/mL in incubation buffer in a separate tube.	Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	[0247] A NADPH-generating system was prepared by combining one aliquot each of the following premade ingredients:	1. 0.5 mL/ aliquot of 10 mL of 600 mM of Glucose-6-phosphate stock solution in	100 mM phosphate buffer;	2. 0.5 mL/ aliquot of 10 mL of 120 mM of NADP stock solution in 100 mM	phosphate buffer; and	3. 0.5 mL/ aliquot of 10 mL of 120 Units/ml Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase	stock solution in 100 mM phosphate buffer,	with an equal volume of 200 mM UDP-GA in 10OmM phosphate buffer stock solution prepared the same day. Each of 1-3 may be stored at -8O0C in aliquot vial until use.	Half-life determination:	[0248] In an appropriate incubation tube, 425 µL of the incubation buffer	containing compound test article at 5.88 µM was combined with 50 µL of the 5 mg/mL diluted liver microsomes and pre-incubated in a 37°C water bath for at least 5 minutes.	25 µL NADPH Generating System was added to the incubation vial, and a 100 µL	aliquot immediately removed from each incubation tube and combined with 300 µL of chilled quench reagent (1 :2 water: acetonitrile) containing internal standard. At each	subsequent incubation time point (15, 30 or 60 min), an additional 100 µL was	removed and quenched. The final concentration of test articles were 5 µM, and final concentration of DMSO solvent in the incubation were 0.4% (v/v).	[0249] Metabolic stability was determined based on disappearance half-life. The percent (%) test article remaining was determined at each incubation time-point,	relative to the zero-time sample. These results were transformed by natural log, such that first-order decline of substrate concentrations with time produced a straight line.	This line was fit with a standard linear regression algorithm, and the slope determined.	If data points suggested higher order elimination kinetics (non linear), then the earliest data points were used for slope calculation. Disappearance half-life in minutes (Ty2) was calculated by multiplying the inverse of this slope by the natural log of 2 {In?).	All data analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel (ver 2007). Results are reported Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	in Table 2 below, in which A represents a half life of < 30 min, B represents a half life of >30 min but <120 min, and C represents a half life of > 120 min, wherein said	values are generally representative of a mean value across several runs of the same test.	NT indicates not tested.	Table 2. Metabolic Stability	Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	In Vivo Assays	Murine LPS Challenge	
WO2009029625_0029	[0250] Inhibition of induction of iNOS can be quantified via the LPS challenge.	Inflammation, edema, and the onset of sepsis can be observed following an injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a substance produced by Gram-negative bacteria. Injection of LPS has been shown to induce iNOS transcription, leading to measureable increases in both iNOS and NO. (Iuvone T et al., Evidence that inducible nitric oxide synthase is involved in LPS-mediated plasma leakage in rat skin through the activation of nuclear factor-?B, Br J Pharm 1998:123 1325-1330.) As described above, the level of nitric oxide in the specimen can be quantified by correlation with plasma nitrate or nitrite	levels via chemiluminescence, fluorescence, spectophotometric assays, or by any	method known in the art which provides adequate sensitivity and reproducibility,	including those described above.	[0251] Male Lewis rats weighing 150-250 g are often used in the studies. Rats	may be fasted for up to 16 hours prior to the administration of LPS. Free access to	water is maintained. Test compounds are administered with LPS or alone. Compounds are dissolved in the vehicle of 0.5% methycele/0.025% Tween 20 or 20% encapsin for oral administration. For the intravenous dosing, compounds are dissolved in saline or 0.5-3%DMSO/20% encapsin. Compounds may also be dissolved in 10% stock	solution of 90% PGE-400, 5% Tween 80, 5%PVP + 90% CMC. The dosing volumes are 1-2 ml for oral and 0.3-1 ml for intravenous administration.	[0252] LPS is injected intravenously (under anesthesia) or intraperitoneally in	sterile 0.9% saline (sodium chloride ) at a dose between 0.1-10 mg/kg in a volume not excess to 1 ml. The needle is 26-30 gauge. Following LPS injection, rats usually	exhibit flu-like symptoms, principally involving lack of activity and diarrhea. In	routine screening experiments, rats are sacrificed 1.5-6 hr after LPS injection and a	terminal bleeding is performed under anesthesia to collect 1-3 ml blood samples and	then animals are then euthanized by CO2.	[0253] A protocol using mice instead of rats was adapted from the methods	disclosed above, adjusting for species and weight differences, for example, using Attorney Docket No. KO 152-401 -PC	modifications well known in the art. Compound 9 was administered at 30 mpk, and	yielded 41% inhibition of NO production versus control.	[0254] From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can easily ascertain	the essential characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions.

Field of the Invention	[0101] The present invention relates generally to the field of inhibitors of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, such as pyπdine[2,3-b]pyrazone deπvatives, pyπdo[4,3-b]pyrazm-2(lH)-one derivatives, and qumoxalm-2(lH)-one deπvatives, and uses for such compounds in treating and/or preventing vaπous human diseases, mediated by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) enzymes, especially diseases related to elevated lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, oily skm conditions, and the like	Background	[0102] Stearoyl CoA desaturases (SCD's) are Δ9 fatty acid desaturases. The mammalian enzymes are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and require molecular O2 and NADH to desaturate saturated fatty acids at the Δ9 position and generate monounsaturated fatty acids and water in the process. The primary substrates for these enzymes are the acyl-CoA derivatives of steaπc (C 18) and palmitic acids (C 16) with the major reaction being the conversion of steaπc acid to oleic acid (C 18:1). Depending on the species, 2-4 isoforms of SCD exist. In rodents these isoforms are highly homologous and differ pπmaπly in tissue distribution In humans there are 2 known isoforms (SCDl and SCD5) and these isoforms function similarly, but SCD5 has reduced sequence homology to other SCD isoforms. Based on tissue distribution SCD5 appears to functionally analogous to rodent SCD2	[0103] The best characteπzed SCD isozyme is SCDl which is pπmaπly found in liver, adipose and skeletal muscle. Deletion, mutation or inhibition of SCDl in mice and rats results in decreased hepatic triglyceride secretion, decreased hepatic triglycerides and steatosis, resistance to weight gain and improvements m insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake (reviewed in Ntambi et al (2004) Prog Lipid Res 43, 91-104, (2005), Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids 73, 35-41; and (2005) Obes. Rev. 6, 169-174). These studies combined with studies in humans showing correlations between surrogates for SCD activity and metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity strongly implicate SCD inhibition as a means to treat obesity, diabetes, hypertryglyceridemia and associated diseases and co-morbidities. Studies done using antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors have also confirmed the results of the SCDl knockout and asebia mouse studies, and clearly shown that hepatic SCD inhibition may reduce elevated hepatic glucose output; see Jiang et al. (2005) J. Clin. Invest. H_5: 1030-1038G. and Gutierrez-Juarez et al. (2006) J. Clin. Invest. 116: 1686-1695 .	[0104] The present invention presents compounds that are useful in inhibiting SCD activity and thus regulating tissue and plasma lipid levels and fatty acid composition. These compounds are useful in the treatment of SCD-mediated diseases such as diseases related to dyslipidemia and disorders of lipid metabolism, including, but not limited to diseases related to elevated lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver diseases, and the like.

Unless specified to the contrary, the solvents used in the reactions of the present invention are inert organic solvents, and the reactions are carried out under an inert gas, preferably nitrogen.	[0319] The term "q.s." means adding a quantity sufficient to achieve a stated function, e.g., to bring a solution to the desired volume (i.e., 100%).	Synthesis of the Compounds of Formula	[0320] One method of preparing compounds of Formula I (e.g. Formula Ib) is shown in Reaction Scheme I.	REACTION SCHEME I	Formula Ib Step 1 - Preparation of Formula (2)	[0321] The compound of formula (2) is made by replacing the halogen group adjacent to the nitro moiety on the commercially available formula (1) compound (i.e., 2,6-dichloro-3-nitropyridine, 2,4-dichloro-5-nitropyridine, 2,4-difluoro-nitrobenzene, or the like) with a compound of formula R1NH2 in the presence of a base. The reaction is earned out in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetone, or ethylacetate, and the like, at a temperature of around -6O0C to around -900C, for about 30 minutes to an hour. The reaction mixture is then allowed to warm to room temperature with continued stirring, approximately 2 to 5 hours. When the reaction is substantially complete, the product of formula (2) is isolated by conventional means, for example by removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, followed by chromatography of the residue on silica gel. Alternatively, the compound of formula (2) is used m the next step without purification.	Step 2 - Preparation of Formula (3)	[0322] The compound of formula (3) is made by replacing the remaining chloro group on the compound of formula (2) with a compound of formula R2NH2 in the presence of a base. A similar procedure is used as descπbed with respect to step 2, however, the reaction is conducted at a temperature of approximately 500C to approximately 800C for 12 to 24 hours. When the reaction is substantially complete, the product of formula (3) may by isolated conventional means but is typically used in the next step without purification.	Step 3 - Preparation of Formula (4)	[0323] The formula (3) nitro compound is then reduced to the corresponding amine analog, compound (4), via conventional reduction techniques. Suitable methods include, but are not limited to, reaction with Na2S2O4 and Na2CO3 at a temperature ranging from 200C to 800C for 10 minutes to 12 hours. After the reaction is allowed to cool to room temperature the product may be extracted by dilution with EtOAc followed by washing with saturated. NaHCO4 solution and bnne. The combined organic phase can then be dried over MgSO4 and concentrated to provide the compound of formula (4) in crude form which can be used in the next step without further purification.	[0324] Alternatively, the nitro group can be reduced by reaction with hydrazine and a Raney-Nickel catalyst. In this method, the nitro compound is placed in a methanol solution to which the hydrazine is added Then the reaction mixture is heated to approximately 500C to 800C and the Raney -Nickel catalyst gently added to insure even and steady evolution of the nitrogen gas The reaction proceeds for approximately 1 hour whereupon the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, the catalyst filtered off, and the filter cake washed with methanol. The resulting solution may be concentrated and purified using conventional methods, i.e., chromatography using a methanol/dichloromethane gradient to provide the desired amine.	
WO2009126123_0007	Step 4 - Preparation of Formula I	[0325] The final step in the synthesis involves the formation of the pyπmidme πng and the addition of the R3 substituent. This is achieved by reacting the amino compound of formula (4) with an ethyl oxoacetate derivative having the desired R3 moiety, i.e., a compound of formula (5). The compound of formula (4) is dissolved in 2% v/v AcOH in EtOH and then the compound of formula (5) is added. The reaction is stirred at 600C to 900C for 12 to 24 hours. The resulting suspension is cooled to room temperature and the final product extracted by the addition of a polar solvent such as methanol followed by filtration and washing with additional polar solvent. The compound of Formula I can then be dπed under vacuum to remove any remaining solvent.	[0326] Alternatively, the pyπmidine πng can be formed by first dissolving the ammo compound of formula (4) into acetonitπle followed by the addition of a catalytic drop of acid, such as glacial acetic acid. The oxoacetate deπvative is then added and the mixture heated for approximately 20 to 40 minutes in a microwave at 1200C. The reaction mixture may them be filtered, concentrated, and purified using column chromatography eluting with MeOH/dichloromethane gradient to provide the compound of Formula I.	Alternative Preparation - R1 is a Nitrogen-Containing Heterocvcle	[0327] Compounds of Formula I wherein R1 is a nitrogen-containing heterocycle may be prepared as described above with the additional requirement that the nitrogen atom in the R1 heterocycle be protected by a suitable protecting group such as an N-terf-butoxycarbonyl group. If desired the protecting group may be removed after Step 4 using conventional techniques, i.e , heating at 600C to 800C in a mixture of acetonitnle and hydrochloπc acid. The acidic mixture is neutralized after cooling with an aqueous base such as KOH and the product extracted using dichloromethane Alternative Preparation - Secondary Modification of R1	[0328] It will be appreciated that secondary modification may be made to the R1 moiety after the compound of Formula I has been made. As was discussed in the R1 heterocycles, this type of modification generally will involve the use of a protected terminal R1 amino group. Once the protecting group is removed, the terminal R1 amino group may be modified by reaction with any number of reactants allowing for the addition of a desired R5 or R7 substituent.	[0329] In one type of secondary modification, the deprotected compound of Formula I is dissolved m the appropπate non-protic solvent, i.e., acetomtπle or the like, and then an acidic version of the desired R5 substituent, R6-C(O)-OH, is added to the reaction mixture followed by 2-(lH-benzotπazol-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) and diisopropylethyleneamme. After briefly heating to approximately 50° to 700C, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and the precipitated end product filtered off and washed with additional solvent to provide the final product of Formula I.	[0330] In another example of secondary modification, after the deprotected compound of Formula I is dissolved in the appropπate non-protic solvent, i.e., acetonitπle, it is placed in a microwave vessel with methyl formate and heated at 135°C to 1500C for 15 to 30 minutes. Cooling and filtration will provide the desired end product.	[0331] In still another example of secondary modification, the deprotected compound of Formula I is dissolved m acetonitπle and dichloromethane. A base such as diisopropylethyleneamme is then added along with{lH]-pyrazole-l-hydroxamidme hydrochloride. The reaction is heated at 300C to 500C for 15 to 30 minutes. Cooling and filtration will provide a compound of Formula I wherein R4 is -C(NH)NH2.

[0346] In specific embodiments of such in vivo processes, said change in SCD activity in said animal is a decrease in activity, preferably wherein said SCD modulating agent does not substantially directly inhibit the biological activity of a Δ5 desaturase, Δ6 desaturase, fatty acid synthetase, or other lipogenic enzymes.	[0347] The model systems useful for compound evaluation may include, but not limited to, the use of liver microsomes, such as from mice or rats that have been maintained on a high carbohydrate or high-fat diet, or from human donors, including persons suffering from obesity. Immortalized cell lines, such as HepG2 (from human liver), MCF-7 (from human breast cancer) and 3T3-L1 (from mouse adipocytes) may also be used. . Primary cell lines, such as mouse primary hepatocytes, are also useful in testing the compounds of the invention. Where whole animals are used, mice or rats used as a source of primary hepatocyte cells may also be used wherein the mice or rats have been maintained on a high carbohydrate or other SCD inducing diet to increase SCD activity m microsomes and/or to elevate plasma and/or tissue triglyceride levels or Δ9 fatty acid desaturation indexes or Δ9 fatty acid desaturation indexes (e.g., the 18:1/18:0 ratio); alternatively mice on a normal diet or mice with normal triglyceride levels may be used. Mouse models having hypertriglyceridemia due to genetic or naturally occurring mutations are also available as is the mouse phenome database. Rabbits, hamsters and monkeys are also useful as animal models, especially those with diabetic and obesity phenotypes.	[0348] Another suitable method for determining the in vivo efficacy of the compounds of the invention is to indirectly measure their impact on inhibition of SCD enzyme by measuring changes in fatty acid composition. These include absolute or relative reductions in SCD product fatty acids such as 16:1 n-7, 18:1 n-7 or 18:1 n-9. As well fatty acid composition data may also be used to determine a subject's Δ9 Desaturation Index after administration of the compound. "Desaturation Index(s)" as employed in this specification means the ratio of the product over the substrate for the SCD enzyme as measured from a given tissue or plasma sample. This may be calculated using different equations, such as 18:ln-9/18:0; 16:ln-7/16:0; and/or (16:1 n-7+ 18: 1 n-7)/ 16:0. Desaturation Index(s) may be measured in plasma or tissues as well as specific lipid classes containing fatty acids such as triglycerides and phospholipids.	Administration	[0349] The compounds of Formula I may be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, for example as descπbed in those patents and patent applications incorporated by reference, including buccal, intranasal, intra-arteπal injection, intravenously, mtraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally, topically, or as an inhalant	[0350] Oral administration is the preferred route for administration of the compounds of Formula I. Administration may be via capsule or enteric coated tablets, or the like. In making the pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one compound of Formula I, the active ingredient is usually diluted by an excipient and/or enclosed withm such a carrier that can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid mateπal (as above), which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or m a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 20% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, sterile injectable solutions, and steπle packaged powders.	[0351] Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, manmtol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup, cyclodextrms, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents.	[0352] The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known m the art. Controlled release drug delivery systems for oral administration include osmotic pump systems and dissolutional systems containing polymer-coated reservoirs or drug-polymer matrix formulations. Examples of controlled release systems are given in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 4,326,525; 4,902514; and 5,616,345.	[0353] In other embodiments, the compounds of the invention are incorporated into a pharmaceutical formulation containing a pharmaceutically acceptable earner that is generally suited to topical drug administration and compπsing any such mateπal known in the art. Suitable earners are well known to those of skill m the art and the selection of the earner will depend upon the form of the intended pharmaceutical formulation, e.g., as an ointment, lotion, cream, foam, microemulsion, gel, oil, solution, spray, salve, or the like, and may be comprised of either naturally occurnng or synthetic matenals. It is understood that the selected earner should not adversely affect the compound of Formula I other components of the pharmaceutical formulation.	[0354] Suitable earners for these types of formulations include, but are not limited to, vehicles including Shephard's Cream, Aquaphor™, and Cetaphil lotion. Other preferred earners include ointment bases, e.g , polyethylene glycol-1000 (PEG-1000), conventional creams such as HEB cream, gels, as well as petroleum jelly and the like. Examples of suitable carriers for use herein include water, alcohols and other nontoxic organic solvents, glycerin, mineral oil, silicone, petroleum jelly, lanohn, fatty acids, vegetable oils, parabens, waxes, and the like. Particularly preferred formulations herein are colorless, odorless ointments, lotions, creams, microemulsions and gels.	[0355] Ointments are semisolid preparations that are typically based on petrolatum or other petroleum derivatives. The specific ointment base to be used, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, is one that will provide for optimum drug delivery, and, preferably, will provide for other desired characteristics as well, e.g., emolliency or the like. As with other carriers or vehicles, an ointment base should be inert, stable, nonirntatmg and nonsensitizing. As explained in Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th Ed. (Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Company, 2000), ointment bases may be grouped in four classes: oleaginous bases; emulsifiable bases; emulsion bases; and water-soluble bases. Oleaginous ointment bases include, for example, vegetable oils, fats obtained from animals, and semisolid hydrocarbons obtained from petroleum. Emulsifiable ointment bases, also known as absorbent ointment bases, contain little or no water and include, for example, hydroxysteaπn sulfate, anhydrous lanolin, and hydrophilic petrolatum. Emulsion ointment bases are either water-m-oil (W/O) emulsions or oil-m-water (OAV) emulsions, and include, for example, cetyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, lanolin, and steaπc acid. Preferred water-soluble ointment bases are prepared from polyethylene glycols (PEGs) of varying molecular weight; again, reference may be had to Remington's, supra, for further information.	[0356] Lotions are preparations to be applied to the skin surface without friction, and are typically liquid or semiliquid preparations m which solid particles, including the active agent, are present in a water or alcohol base Lotions are usually suspensions of solids, and preferably, for the present purpose, compπse a liquid oily emulsion of the oil-m-water type. Lotions are preferred formulations herein for treating large body areas, because of the ease of applying a more fluid composition It is generally necessary that the insoluble matter in a lotion be finely divided. Lotions will typically contain suspending agents to produce better dispersions as well as compounds useful for localizing and holding the active agent in contact with the skin, e.g., methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or the like. A particularly preferred lotion formulation for use in conjunction with the present invention contains propylene glycol mixed with a hydrophilic petrolatum such as that which may be obtained under the trademark Aquaphor™ from Beiersdorf, Inc. (Norwalk, Conn.).	[0357] Creams containing the active agent are, as known in the art, viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions, either oil-m-water or water-in-oil. Cream bases are water-washable, and contain an oil phase, an emulsifier, and an aqueous phase. The oil phase is generally comprised of petrolatum and a fatty alcohol such as cetyl or stearyl alcohol; the aqueous phase usually, although not necessarily, exceeds the oil phase in volume, and generally contains a humectant. The emulsifier in a cream formulation, as explained in Remington's, supra, is generally a nonionic, anionic, cationic, or amphoteric surfactant.	[0358] Microemulsions are thermodynamically stable, isotropically clear dispersions of two immiscible liquids, such as oil and water, stabilized by an interfacial film of surfactant molecules (Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology (New York: Marcel Dekker, 1992), volume 9). For the preparation of microemulsions, a surfactant (emulsifier), a co-surfactant (co-emulsifier), an oil phase, and a water phase are necessary. Suitable surfactants include any surfactants that are useful in the preparation of emulsions, e.g., emulsifiers that are typically used in the preparation of creams. The co-surfactant (or "co-emulsifer") is generally selected from the group of polyglycerol derivatives, glycerol derivatives, and fatty alcohols. Preferred emulsifier/co-emulsifier combinations are generally although not necessaπly selected from the group consisting of: glyceryl monostearate and polyoxyethylene stearate; polyethylene glycol and ethylene glycol palmitostearate; and capπlic and capπc triglycerides and oleoyl macrogolglyceπdes. The water phase includes not only water but also, typically, buffers, glucose, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, preferably lower molecular weight polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 300 and PEG 400), and/or glycerol, and the like, while the oil phase will generally compπse, for example, fatty acid esters, modified vegetable oils, silicone oils, mixtures of mono- di- and triglycerides, mono- and di-esters of PEG (e.g., oleoyl macrogol glyceπdes), etc.	[0359] Gel formulations are semisolid systems consisting of either small inorganic particle suspensions (two-phase systems) or large organic molecules distributed substantially uniformly throughout a carrier liquid (single phase gels). Single phase gels can be made, for example, by combining the active agent, a earner liquid and a suitable gelling agent such as tragacanth (at 2 to 5%), sodium alginate (at 2-10%), gelatin (at 2-15%), methylcellulose (at 3-5%), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (at 2-5%), carbomer (at 0.3-5%) or polyvinyl alcohol (at 10-20%) together and mixing until a characteristic semisolid product is produced. Other suitable gelling agents include methylhydroxycellulose, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene, hydroxyethylcellulose and gelatin. Although gels commonly employ aqueous earner liquid, alcohols and oils can be used as the carrier liquid as well.	[0360] Various additives, known to those skilled in the art, may be included in the topical formulations of the invention. Examples of additives include, but are not limited to, solubihzers, skm permeation enhancers, opacifiers, preservatives (e.g., anti-oxidants), gelling agents, buffeπng agents, surfactants (particularly nonionic and amphoteric surfactants), emulsifiers, emollients, thickening agents, stabilizers, humectants, colorants, fragrance, and the like Inclusion of solubilizers and/or skm permeation enhancers is particularly preferred, along with emulsifiers, emollients, and preservatives.	[0361] Examples of solubilizers include, but are not limited to, the following: hydrophilic ethers such as diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (ethoxydiglycol, available commercially as Transcutol™) and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether oleate (available commercially as Softcutol™); polyethylene castor oil deπvatives such as polyoxy 35 castor oil, polyoxy 40 hydrogenated castor oil, etc.; polyethylene glycol, particularly lower molecular weight polyethylene glycols such as PEG 300 and PEG 400, and polyethylene glycol deπvatives such as PEG-8 caprylic/capπc glyceπdes (available commercially as Labrasol ); alkyl methyl sulfoxides such as DMSO; pyrrohdones such as 2-pyrrolidone and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; and DMA. Many solubilizers can also act as absorption enhancers A single solubihzer may be incorporated into the formulation, or a mixture of solubilizers may be incorporated therein.	[0362] Suitable emulsifiers and co-emulsifiers include, without limitation, those emulsifiers and co-emulsifϊers descπbed with respect to microemulsion formulations. Emollients include, for example, propylene glycol, glycerol, isopropyl myristate, polypropylene glycol-2 (PPG-2) myπstyl ether propionate, and the like.	[0363] Other active agents may also be included in the formulation, e.g., anti-inflammatory agents, analgesics, antimicrobial agents, antifungal agents, antibiotics, vitamins, antioxidants, and sunblock agents commonly found m sunscreen formulations including, but not limited to, anthranilates, benzophenones (particularly benzophenone-3), camphor denvatives, cmnamates (e g , octyl methoxycmnamate), dibenzoyl methanes (e.g., butyl methoxydibenzoyl methane), p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and deπvatives thereof, and salicylates (e.g , octyl salicylate).	[0364] In the preferred topical formulations of the invention, the active agent is present in an amount in the range of approximately 0.25 wt. % to 75 wt % of the formulation, preferably in the range of approximately 0.25 wt. % to 30 wt. % of the formulation, more preferably in the range of approximately 0.5 wt. % to 15 wt. % of the formulation, and most preferably in the range of approximately 1.0 wt. % to 10 wt. % of the formulation	[0365] Also, the pharmaceutical formulation may be steπhzed or mixed with auxiliary agents, e g , preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, buffers, or salts for influencing osmotic pressure and the like. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the compound of Formula I or Formula II m the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients as enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered steπhzation. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various steπhzed active ingredients into a steπle vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of steπle powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.	[0366] Another formulation for use in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices ("patches")- Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known m the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,023,252, 4,992,445 and 5,001,139. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.	[0367] SCD inhibitors such as the compounds of Formula I are effective over a wide dosage range and are generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount Typically, for oral administration, each dosage unit contains from 1 mg to 2 g of an SCD inhibitor, more commonly from 1 to 700 mg, and for parenteral administration, from 1 to 700 mg of a stearoyl-CoA desaturase inhibitor, more commonly about 2 to 200 mg. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the SCD inhibitor actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered and its relative activity, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.	[0368] For prepaπng solid compositions such as tablets, the pπncipal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules	[0369] The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action, or to protect from the acid conditions of the stomach. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former The two components can be separated by an enteric layer that serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeπc acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate	
WO2009126123_0008	[0370] Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions m pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as descπbed supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, e.g. orally or nasally, from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.

It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventor to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spiπt and scope of the invention.

WO2009126123_0012	Preparation of Rat Liver Microsomes	[0490] The rat liver microsomes were collected according to the procedure descπbed m Ozols (1990) Methods Enzm, 182:225 .	In vivo expeπment (Liver perfusion and collection')	[0491] Male Spraque Dawley Rats were placed on regimented fasting protocol for one week to stimulate SCD enzymatic activity. 48-hour periods were alternated between feeding and fasting to induce and down-regulate SCD activity with SCD activity being induced via carbohydrate πch diet pπor to liver perfusion and collection.	[0492] The rats were anesthetized with Isoflurane inhalation anesthetic, the liver perfused with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), weighed, and chilled in cold homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tπs, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6.	[0493] The livers were finely minced and placed in homogenization tube. 40 mL of homogenization buffer was added to the homogenization tube and the liver homogenized and centrifuged in a pre-chilled SLA-600 TC at 800G rotor for 10 mm at 4°C.	[0494] Following centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and the pellet removed and discarded. This supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000G for 35 minutes. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and the pellet discarded. The supernatant was further centrifuged in a pre-chilled 45-Ti rotor at 130,000G (41,000 RPM) for 90 minutes at 4°C. .

This assay buffer contained 0.1 M Tπs buffer, pH 7.2, 2 mM NADH, 4.8 mM ATP, 0.5 mM CoA, 4.8 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% BSA.	The Procedure for the SCD Assay (Adapted from Talamo and Bloch (1969) Analytical Biochemistry 29:300-304)	[0500] lμl of each compound of Formula I was added to an assay plate by a low volume (0.5-lOμL) multichannel pipette. A DMSO control was also prepared. The microsomes were quickly thawed and added to assay buffer so that a concentration of 1-0.1 mg/ml was achieved (0.5- 0.05 mg/ml assay final). 50μl of the microsome suspension in assay buffer was then added into each well in the compound assay plate, the plate was covered, and the microsomes premcubated with the compounds for 30-60 minutes on the orbital shaker, 50-75rpm, at room temperature.	[0501] After preincubation, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of substrate solution (20μM Stearoyl CoA, [3H]Stearoyl CoA, 74nCi) to the premcubated microsomes/compound suspensions in MiIhQ (Millrpore) H2O. The reaction mixtures were then incubated for 45 minutes on the orbital shaker at 50-75 rpm at room temperature.	[0502] The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 21% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to the reaction mixture followed incubation on the orbital shaker for 30 minutes at 50-75 rpm at room temperature followed by centπfugation for 5 minutes at 3700 rpm.	[0503] 50μl of a 6% Bio-Bead suspension in H2O was added to the reaction mixture and the assay plate was sealed. The Bio-Bead mixture was incubated on the orbital shaker for 1 to 24 hours, 100-150 rpm at room temperature, and then the mixture was centπfuged at 200Og for 5 minutes to pellet the Bio-Beads.
